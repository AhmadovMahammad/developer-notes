Why This Repository Exists

As a backend developer primarily working with C#, I decided to start learning C++ to deepen my understanding of low-level programming, memory management, and system-level thinking. C++ offers a different programming model compared to C#, especially in terms of performance control, resource handling, and manual memory management.

This repository is a structured notebook of my C++ learning journey. I'm following the material from learncpp.com and summarizing key concepts in a clear and organized manner. All notes, code samples, and exercises are my own interpretations and implementations based on what I study.

I chose to keep this public for two main reasons:

  - To track my progress through meaningful commits.
  - To share my learning path with others who might come from high-level languages like C# and want a relatable way into C++.

The content will grow over time, commit by commit, as I move through the chapters and revisit topics with deeper understanding.
