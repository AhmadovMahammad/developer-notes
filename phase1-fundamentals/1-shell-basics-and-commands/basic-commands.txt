1. `cd` - Change Directory

This command is used to move between folders (directories) in the file system.

But let’s go deeper. The terminal session always has a concept of a current working directory - that’s the directory you're "inside" when you type a command.

The `cd` command modifies this current directory.

cd /home/mahammad/Downloads

This changes your current path into the `Downloads` folder.
So if you now run `pwd`, it will show: /home/mahammad/Downloads

-_-

You can use: cd ..

This moves you up one level. If you're in `/home/mahammad/Downloads`, `cd ..` takes you to `/home/mahammad`.

The `..` means “parent directory”.

-_-

You can also use: cd ~

This will always take you to your home directory, such as `/home/mahammad`.

And, cd with no arguments does exactly the same - go to your home directory.

-_-

Now, one very useful trick:

cd -

This goes to the previous directory. Think of it as an undo.

Let’s say:

```
cd /etc
cd /var/log
cd -
```

You will be taken back to `/etc`.

2. `ls` - List Directory Contents

This command is used to see what’s inside a directory.
But there’s a lot more under the surface.

Basic usage: ls
lists the contents of the current directory.

If you do: ls foldername => it lists what’s inside that folder.

-_-

But `ls` has very useful flags:

```
ls -l
```

This gives you a long format listing, showing:

```
drwxrwxr-x 5 mahammad-ahmadov mahammad-ahmadov 4096 Jun  4 18:33 phase1-fundamentals
```

This tells you the file is:

[1]  drwxrwxr-x  
[2]  5  
[3]  mahammad-ahmadov  
[4]  mahammad-ahmadov  
[5]  4096  
[6]  Jun  4 18:33  
[7]  phase1-fundamentals


[1] drwxrwxr-x
This is file type + permissions - it has 10 characters.

First character: d = directory. If it's -, it's a regular file.
The next 9 characters are permissions, in 3 groups:

rwx  rwx  r-x
│     │     │
│     │     └── others
│     └──────── group
└────────────── owner

Owner: rwx = read, write, execute → 7
Group: rwx = read, write, execute → 7
Others: r-x = read, no write, execute → 5


[2] 5 - What is this number?
This is the link count - the number of hard links pointing to this directory.
At the end, there is detailed information about LINKS

-_-

Another important flag:

```
ls -a
```

This shows all files, including hidden files (those starting with a dot `.` like `.bashrc` or `.git`).

You can combine flags:

```
ls -la
```

or

```
ls -lh
```

Here `-h` gives “human-readable” file sizes like `5K`, `2M`, etc.

To list directories only:

```
ls -d */
```

This is advanced, but very useful.
Let’s look at how it works:

This command looks short, but under the hood, it's a combination of two key things: 
1. how globbing (`*`) works and 2. how `ls -d` behaves.

Let’s break it fully:

-_-

What does `*` mean?

In Bash, `*` is a glob pattern. 
It expands to match any filename or folder name in the current directory. 
For example, if you have:

```
file1.txt
folder1/
script.sh
data/
```

Then `*` expands to:

```
file1.txt folder1 script.sh data and the children of subdirectories
```

-_-

What does `*/` mean?

This is also a glob, but with a trailing slash.

This means:
match anything (`*`) that is a directory (`/`).

So `*/` matches:

```
folder1/
data/
```

It will not match `file1.txt` or `script.sh`, because those are not directories.
if we have written it like *.txt, it would show files with .txt extension.

-_-

What does `ls -d` do?
Normally, when you run:

```
ls folder1
```

You get the contents inside `folder1`.

But when you run:

```
ls -d folder1
```

You don’t get what's inside. You get the folder name itself.
So `-d` means: don’t go inside the directory, just treat it like a file and show its name.

-_-

Putting it all together

```
ls -d */
```

Here's the full logic:

1. `*/` is expanded by Bash into a list of directory names, like:

   ```
   folder1/ data/
   ```

2. `ls -d` receives this expanded list and says:
   “Don’t go inside these directories. Just list their names.”

So the output is a clean list of only directory names in the current folder, like:

```
folder1/  data/
```

No files are shown. No contents of folders are listed.

3. `pwd` - Print Working Directory
This is a simple command that tells you your current location in the filesystem - the full absolute path.

For example: pwd

might return:

```
/home/mahammad/projects/bash-course
```

-_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_-_-

4. `mkdir` - Make Directory
This command creates folders.

Basic usage: mkdir new_folder

creates a folder in the current directory.

But if the parent folder doesn’t exist, it will fail:

```
mkdir a/b/c
```

will fail if `a` or `a/b` doesn't exist.

To fix that:

```
mkdir -p a/b/c
```

The `-p` flag tells it to create parent directories as needed.

This is very useful in scripts.

1. If the folder already exists:
without `-p`, you’ll get an error:

```
mkdir: cannot create directory ‘a’: File exists
```

2. with `-p`, it will silently skip creating it again.

So always use `-p` when you're not sure the folders exist or not.

-_-

Also:

```
mkdir -v foldername
```

prints what it creates:

This is optional but useful for logging or scripts.

5. What `rm` really does

The real nature of files in Linux

In Linux (and Unix systems), a file is not just its name. 
The name is only a label stored in a directory entry - it maps to something deeper called an inode.

An inode is a data structure that contains:

* metadata: permissions, ownership, size, modification time
* a list of blocks (disk locations) where the actual content (the file's data) lives

The file name itself is not stored inside the inode. 
The name only exists in the directory that contains the file. This is crucial to understand.

So in reality, your file system works like this:

```
Directory entry: "file.txt" → inode 12345 → actual content
```

What does `rm` actually do?

When you run:

```
rm file.txt
```

Linux looks up `file.txt` in the current directory. It finds that this name points to inode 12345 (for example). 
Then, `rm` removes the name from the directory. That’s all.
The inode 12345 is now no longer referenced by this name.

Now comes the important part:
When is the inode (and file content) deleted?

Linux keeps a reference count inside the inode. This count tells: how many names (directory entries / hard links) point to me?
If the count drops to zero - meaning no names point to the inode anymore, and no program is keeping the file open, 
then the system knows the file is truly unreachable, and it frees the disk space.

But if you had another hard link pointing to the same inode, like this:

```
ln file.txt second_name.txt
```

Then both `file.txt` and `second_name.txt` point to inode 12345. Deleting just one:

```
rm file.txt
```

doesn’t destroy the content. It only removes one label. The data lives on via the second name.
Only when you remove all links to the inode, the system cleans it up.

-_- Are files moved to trash?

No. `rm` does not move files to trash or recycle bin. There is no built-in undo.

Graphical interfaces (like GNOME or KDE) simulate trash by moving files to `~/.local/share/Trash`, but `rm` bypasses all that. 
It talks directly to the file system. It unlinks the directory entry.

So recovery is difficult unless:

* You shut down the system quickly to prevent disk overwrite
* You use specialized inode-recovery tools (low chance of success)
* You had backups

-_-

`-i` (interactive)
Before removing each file, ask for confirmation.

```
rm -i important.txt
```

Terminal will ask:
`rm: remove regular file 'important.txt'?`
This prevents accidental deletions.

-_-

`-f` (force)
This forces deletion - even if the file is write-protected, or doesn't exist (no error). It disables any prompt.

```
rm -f dontcare.txt
```

This is dangerous if used alone or in scripts.

-_-

`-r` or `-R` (recursive)
This is how you delete directories and everything inside them (files and subdirectories).

```
rm -r myfolder/
```

This walks through the directory tree and removes everything it finds.
If you don’t use `-r`, you cannot delete a directory.

-_-

`-rf` (recursive + force)

```
rm -rf myfolder/
```

This is the most dangerous version. It:

* Deletes everything inside `myfolder`
* Does not ask for confirmation
* Ignores errors

It’s powerful in scripts, but risky in real terminal work.

-_-

Example for combined usage
Imagine you have a folder `old_project` with lots of nested folders and protected files. This command:

```
rm -rf old_project
```

will silently wipe the entire folder tree in one go. No undo.

-_-

Some tips and best practices

* Use `-i` or `-I` (capital i, less intrusive) if you want safety
* Always double-check the path before using `rm -rf`
* Never run `rm -rf /` or `rm -rf *` without thinking
* Use `echo` before running: `echo rm -rf myfolder` to verify you typed it right

-_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_-_-

6. What `cp` really does
The `cp` command creates a new file with its own inode and content, and copies the data from the original file into it.

So when you run:

```
cp file.txt backup.txt
```

you are not creating a new label (like a hard link does). You are actually creating:

* a brand new directory entry: `backup.txt`
* a brand new inode: say inode 23456
* new disk blocks for file content (same content as the original)
* the data from `file.txt` is copied block-by-block into the new location

This is important: `backup.txt` and `file.txt` now live completely independently. 
They point to different inodes, and each inode has its own reference count, timestamps, and file content blocks.

If you delete or change one of them, the other remains untouched.

-_-

Comparison with `ln` (hard link)

Let’s contrast this.

With:

```
ln file.txt alias.txt
```

you get:

* One inode (shared)
* Two names (labels): `file.txt` and `alias.txt`
* Same reference count = 2

But with:

```
cp file.txt new_copy.txt
```

you get:

* Two different inodes
* Two different sets of data
* No connection at all between the two

That’s why `cp` uses more disk space. It creates a full new copy.

-_-

What happens inside `cp`

When you run `cp`, Linux:

1. Opens the source file (say `file.txt`)
2. Creates a new empty file (`backup.txt`)
3. Reads chunks (e.g. 4096 bytes) from the original file
4. Writes those chunks into the new file
5. Copies over basic metadata (like permissions, unless you say not to)

So the copying happens at the content level, not at the inode level. It’s a real duplication.

-_-

What about directories?

If you want to copy an entire directory, you must use:

```
cp -r myfolder/ backup/
```

The `-r` means recursive. It tells `cp`:

* go inside the directory
* copy every file and subfolder
* recreate the structure exactly

If you try to copy a directory without `-r`, you get an error:

```
cp: -r not specified; omitting directory 'myfolder'
```

-_-

Important `cp` options

Only a few flags are very important for deeper work:

* `cp -r`: recursive copy (for directories)
* `cp -a`: archive mode (preserves symbolic links, file permissions, timestamps, owner, etc.)
* `cp -u`: only copy if the destination file is older or missing
* `cp -i`: interactive - ask before overwriting
* `cp -v`: verbose - show each file being copied

For example:

```
cp -av myfolder/ backup/
```

will recursively copy the folder while preserving metadata and showing each file it copies.

-_-

Analogy

Think of `cp` like duplicating a document in real life:

* You take `file.txt`, open it, read it
* You write a brand new copy on a fresh page (that becomes `backup.txt`)
* Now you have two separate sheets of paper. Changing one doesn't affect the other.

But with `ln`, you had one shared page with two sticky notes pointing to it. Changing content affects both.

-_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_-_-

7. What `mv` really does

On the surface, `mv` stands for “move,” and you might think it copies a file and deletes the original, like `cp` + `rm`. 
But that’s not usually true. 
The real behavior depends on where you're moving the file to - whether it's the same filesystem (partition) or not.

Case 1: Moving within the same filesystem (most common case)

When you run:

```
mv file.txt renamed.txt
```

inside the same directory or partition, no data is copied. The file’s content and inode stay exactly the same. 
Only the directory entry (the name → inode mapping) is changed.

So `mv` is just updating metadata:

* Remove the label `file.txt` from the current directory
* Add a new label `renamed.txt` pointing to the same inode
* That’s it - the file wasn’t touched or moved on disk

That’s why it’s very fast - even for huge files. You’re not moving gigabytes; you’re just changing a string in the directory table.

So:

```
mv oldname newname
```

is just a rename operation if done on the same filesystem.

-_-

Case 2: Moving across different filesystems

Now imagine this:

```
mv /mnt/driveA/file.txt /home/user/
```

If `/mnt/driveA/` is on a different partition than `/home/user/`, then `mv` can’t just rename the label. 
Different filesystems have their own inode tables. You can’t simply point to the same inode.

So here, `mv` actually does this:

1. Reads the content of `file.txt`
2. Creates a new file in `/home/user/` with the same data
3. Deletes the original file in `/mnt/driveA/`

This is basically `cp + rm`.

So it becomes a real move only across filesystems.

-_-

What happens when renaming folders?
Same logic. If you run:

```
mv myfolder/ mynewfolder/
```

and it’s on the same filesystem, then it simply updates the directory’s label - very fast.
If it’s across filesystems, then it copies everything inside recursively, and deletes the original.

You can check that with:

```
ls -i file.txt
mv file.txt newname.txt
ls -i newname.txt
```

You’ll see the inode number remains the same.

-_-

Hidden power of `mv`: replacing files

If the destination exists, `mv` overwrites it without warning, unless you use `-i`.

So this is dangerous:

```
mv report.txt final.txt
```

If `final.txt` already exists, it’s gone. To be safer:

```
mv -i report.txt final.txt
```

asks:

```
mv: overwrite 'final.txt'? (y/n)
```

-_-

Key flags of `mv`

There are only a few that matter deeply:

* `-i` (interactive): prompts before overwriting
* `-n` (no-clobber): never overwrite existing files
* `-v` (verbose): shows what is being moved

Example:

```
mv -iv draft.txt article.txt
```

asks before replacing, and tells you what was done.

8. What `touch` really does
The main purpose of `touch` is to update file timestamps - not to write content, not to open editors, 
not even to fill the file with zeroes. It touches the file’s metadata, specifically the access time and modification time.

Let’s say you do:

```
touch notes.txt
```

Now two scenarios can happen:

Case 1: `notes.txt` does not exist

Then `touch` will create an empty file. 
Not 0 bytes of zeros - it creates an inode entry with no content blocks, 
and just allocates the metadata part (inode). This is the case that feels like “creating a file.”

Case 2: `notes.txt` already exists

Then `touch` doesn’t change the content at all. Instead, it updates:

* `atime` (last access time) - when file was last read
* `mtime` (last modification time) - when content was last changed
* sometimes also `ctime` (metadata change time), depending on the filesystem

This lets you refresh the file's metadata without modifying the content.

-_-

Why is this useful?

In Unix-like systems, every file has a timestamp triple:

* access time - when the file was last read
* modification time - when the file content was changed
* change time - when inode metadata (like permissions) was changed

```
stat greet.txt 
```

  File: greet.txt
  Size: 146       	Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   regular file

Inode: 2279142     Links: 1

Access: 2025-06-06 17:42:12.031955961 +0400
Modify: 2025-05-27 23:41:06.320740396 +0400
Change: 2025-05-27 23:41:06.320740396 +0400
Birth: 2025-05-27 23:39:43.662440310 +0400

These times matter for:

* Makefiles: which files are "newer" than others
* Backup systems: only backup changed files
* Caching: expire based on last modification

`touch` lets you manually control this timeline - you can make a file look newer than it is, or simulate recent use.

after using touch command on this file: 

  File: greet.txt
  Size: 146       	Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   regular file

Inode: 2279142     Links: 1

Access: 2025-06-06 20:14:29.633280250 +0400
Modify: 2025-06-06 20:14:29.633280250 +0400
Change: 2025-06-06 20:14:29.633280250 +0400
Birth: 2025-05-27 23:39:43.662440310 +0400

only birth date remains unchanged.

-_-

A real case:

Imagine you have:

```
program
config.cfg
```

And the program only re-parses `config.cfg` if its modification time is newer than a lockfile. You can do:

touch config.cfg
Now it appears “freshly edited” even if the content didn’t change.

-_- Some important flags for `touch`

touch -c file.txt
This does not create the file if it doesn’t exist. It only updates time if it exists.

-_-

touch -a file.txt
Only updates the access time (when it was last read).

-_-

touch -m file.txt
Only updates the modification time (when it was last written).

9. `cat` - Concatenate and Display Files

The name `cat` comes from concatenate, meaning to join things together. But when used alone, most people think of `cat` just as:

```
cat file.txt
```

This displays the file content to the screen (standard output). But what is really happening?

Under the hood, `cat`:

1. Opens the file for reading
2. Reads the byte stream from beginning to end
3. Sends that stream to stdout, which usually means your terminal screen
4. If multiple files are passed, it joins their content in the given order

So when you do:

```
cat a.txt b.txt > combined.txt
```

It’s literally:

* Reading all of `a.txt`
* Then all of `b.txt`
* Writing them into `combined.txt` as one continuous file

This is why it's called concatenate.

-_-

`cat` is also used with redirection:

For example:

```
cat > newfile.txt
```

Now it’s not reading from a file, but from standard input - your keyboard.

You can type something like:

```
Hello World
This is a test
```

Then press `Ctrl + D` to end. That ends input stream and writes it to the file.

So now, `newfile.txt` will contain what you typed.

-_- Common flags for `cat`

1. ```
cat -n file.txt
```

Adds line numbers to each line of output.

-_-

Summary

`cat` is a tool to:

* display
* merge
* redirect
* clean

text files in Unix systems, working directly with raw byte streams and standard input/output.

10. `nano` - A Text Editor in Terminal

`nano` is an interactive terminal-based text editor. 
Not just a display tool like `cat`, but an actual editor that lets you move around, write, delete, and save.

When you run:

```
nano notes.txt
```

This happens:

* If the file exists, it opens it in a mini editor screen inside the terminal
* If it doesn’t exist, it starts a new empty buffer with that name
* You can then type content, navigate with arrow keys, and use keyboard shortcuts

At the bottom of the screen, you’ll see something like:

```
^O Write Out    ^X Exit    ^K Cut Line    ^U Uncut Line
```

This means:

* `Ctrl + O` saves the file (write out)
* `Ctrl + X` exits nano
* `Ctrl + K` cuts a line (like delete)
* `Ctrl + U` pastes what you cut

11. `echo` - Print to Standard Output
At first glance, `echo` seems too simple. You do:

```
echo Hello
```

And it prints `Hello`.

But behind this simplicity, it’s a shell built-in that works with strings, environment variables, 
file redirection, and even escape sequences.

-_- Common examples

1. ```
echo $HOME
```

This prints your home directory, because `$HOME` is an environment variable.

ahammad-ahmadov@R:~/Documents$ echo $HOME
/home/mahammad-ahmadov


2. ```
echo "My name is $USER"
```

Shell will replace `$USER` with your username.

mahammad-ahmadov@R:~/Documents$ echo $USER
mahammad-ahmadov


3. ```
echo "Line 1\nLine 2"
```

This won’t show a newline, because by default `\n` is not interpreted.
To enable escape sequences, use `-e`:

```
echo -e "Line 1\nLine 2"
```

Now you’ll see two lines.

-_-

echo with redirection
You can write to a file:

4. ```
echo "Hello File" > hello.txt
```

This creates or replaces the file.

Or append:

5. ```
echo "Another line" >> hello.txt
```

Now the new line goes to the end of the file.


-_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_- Detailed information about Links -_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_-

What is a link in Linux?

When you see a file or a folder name in Linux (like `file.txt` or `folder/`), that name is actually just a label. 
Behind that label, there is a real thing that stores all the information and data. That real thing is called an inode.

You can think of it like this:

* The name you see in the folder is like a shortcut.
* The inode is where Linux keeps the file’s real data and details (size, permissions, etc).

So the filename is just a way to access that inode.

-_-

1. What is a hard link?
A hard link is just another name for the same file.

Let’s say you have a file:

```
echo "Hello" > original.txt
```

Now you make a hard link:

```
ln original.txt second.txt
```

Now both `original.txt` and `second.txt` point to the same file content. They are not copies.
They are like two doors to the same room.

You can even delete one of them, and the other will still work, because the real data is still there.
You can check the file inode like this:

```
ls -li original.txt second.txt
```

If both show the same number at the start (inode), they are the same file.

2237267 -rw-rw-r--  2 mahammad-ahmadov mahammad-ahmadov        6 Jun  4 22:32  original.txt
2237267 -rw-rw-r--  2 mahammad-ahmadov mahammad-ahmadov        6 Jun  4 22:32  second.txt

-_--_-

2. What is a symbolic link?
A symbolic link (also called symlink) is not a real copy. It’s like a shortcut or pointer to another file.

Example:

```
ln -s original.txt shortcut.txt
```

This creates a special file called `shortcut.txt`, which points to `original.txt`.
If you delete `original.txt`, the symlink will be broken (because the file it points to is gone).

You can see this link by:

```
ls -l shortcut.txt
```

It will show something like:

```
lrwxrwxrwx 1 mahammad-ahmadov mahammad-ahmadov 12 Jun  4 22:54 shortcut.txt -> original.txt
```

-_--_-

What is the link count you see in `ls -l`?

When you run:

```
ls -l
```

You see something like:

```
drwxrwxr-x 5 mahammad-ahmadov mahammad-ahmadov 4096 Jun  4 18:33 phase1-fundamentals
```

Let’s break it: The number 5 is the link count

This is the number of hard links to this folder.

Every folder always has:

1. a link to itself (`.`)
2. a link from its parent folder (`..`)
3. and every subfolder inside it adds 1 more link, because each subfolder has a `..` that points back to this folder

So, the formula is:

```
link count = 2 + number of subdirectories
```

If `myfolder` shows a link count of `5`, then:

* It has 2 links automatically (`.` and `..`)
* And it must have 3 subfolders inside it

-_-

1. Why do `.` and `..` exist?

These are special names built into every directory.
They are used for navigation and structure in the filesystem.

* `.` means “this directory”
* `..` means “the parent directory”

Linux filesystems are structured like a tree. You can go up and down between folders. 
These two entries help with that.

Example:

```
cd ..
```

This works because every folder has a `..` entry that tells the system where the parent is.

-_-

2. Are `.` and `..` hard links?

Yes, technically, they are hard links.

Here is how:

* `.` is a hard link that points to the inode of the folder itself.
* `..` is a hard link that points to the inode of the parent folder.

That’s why they increase the link count.

Let’s say we have this:

```
/home/mahammad/
```

Inside this folder:

* `.` is `/home/mahammad` pointing to itself.
* `..` is `/home`, the parent.

Now imagine you make a subfolder:

```
mkdir /home/mahammad/projects
```

Inside `projects`:

* `.` is `/home/mahammad/projects`
* `..` is `/home/mahammad`

So `/home/mahammad` now has one more hard link, because `projects/..` points back to it. 
That’s why its link count grows by 1.

-_-

3. Why do filenames act like labels?

In Linux, a file system is inode-based.
An inode is like a box in memory or disk that stores:

* file content location
* metadata (size, owner, permissions, timestamps)
* but not the filename

That’s key:
Filename is not inside the inode.
It lives in a directory entry, which is like a mapping:

```
filename → inode number
```

You can think of it like this:

* A folder is a table: it maps names to inode numbers.
* Each file has an inode with its true identity.
* Multiple names (hard links) can point to the same inode.

That’s why filenames are just pointers. If you remove a filename but another name still points to the same inode, 
the file still exists.
