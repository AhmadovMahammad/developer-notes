State management is the core of any interactive web application, determining how data is stored, updated, and maintained across different UI elements and user interactions. In Blazor Server, managing state correctly is crucial because the framework uses a real-time SignalR connection to communicate with the browser.

Blazor dynamically re-renders components based on state changes, and improper handling of state can lead to unnecessary re-renders, lost data on navigation, or inefficient resource usage. To understand this, we must distinguish between two fundamental types of state:

- **Component State**: Data that exists only within a single component's lifecycle.
- **Application State**: Data that persists beyond a single component, often shared across multiple components.

Both of these states operate differently, influencing how the UI updates and how data is retained across user interactions.

## 1. Component State in Blazor Server

Component state is internal to a single component and does not persist beyond its lifecycle. When a Blazor component is rendered, its fields and properties hold the state. If the component is removed from the UI (for example, by navigating to a different page), its state is discarded.

This means that component state is ephemeral—it lives as long as the component is active. When the component is reloaded or recreated, it starts fresh.

---
### How Does Component State Work?

Component state is simply private fields or properties inside a component. These fields hold values that are used in rendering, and when these values change, Blazor automatically re-renders the component.

---
### Example: Simple Component State (Counter Example)

```c#
@page "/counter"
<PageTitle>Counter</PageTitle>

<h1>Counter</h1>
<p role="status">Current count: @currentCount</p>
<button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="IncrementCount">Click me</button>

@code {
    private int currentCount = 0; // This is component state

    private void IncrementCount()
    {
        currentCount++; // State changes, triggering a re-render
    }
}
```

In this example, `currentCount` is a component-scoped state variable. When the button is clicked, the `IncrementCount` method updates the state, causing Blazor to automatically re-render the component with the new value.

However, if the user navigates away from this component and returns, the `currentCount` will reset to `0`. This happens because the component is re-instantiated when it is rendered again.

---
### When Does Component State Reset?

Since the component state is tied to the component’s lifecycle, it resets when:
- The component is removed from the UI.
- The user navigates away from the page.
- The component is dynamically refreshed or reloaded.

---
### Limitations of Component State

Component state is not suitable for scenarios where data needs to persist across multiple components or when data should survive page navigation. For example, a user's session data, form inputs across multiple pages, or real-time updates shared between components should not rely solely on component state. For these cases, application state is required.

---
## 2. Application State in Blazor Server

Application state is persisted beyond a single component’s lifecycle and can be accessed by multiple components. It is commonly used for:
- Sharing state between different components.
- Keeping data persistent across navigation.
- Managing data that should not be tied to a single component instance.

Since Blazor is server-side, storing state in-memory (inside a singleton service) means it persists as long as the user is connected. However, once the user disconnects, the in-memory state is lost unless explicitly persisted (e.g., in a database or session storage).

---
### How to Manage Application State?

Blazor Server does not provide built-in global state management, but the recommended way to handle it is by using a service class and injecting it via dependency injection (DI). This allows multiple components to share and modify the same instance of the state.

---
### Example: Application State Using a Service (Shared Counter State)

#### Step 1: Create a State Management Service

```csharp
public class CounterStateService
{
    public int Count { get; private set; } = 0; // Shared state

    public event Action? OnChange;  // Notifies components when state changes

    public void IncrementCount()
    {
        Count++;
        OnChange?.Invoke();
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: Register the Service in Dependency Injection

In `Program.cs`, register the service as a singleton:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddSingleton<CounterStateService>();
```

A singleton ensures that the service instance is shared across all components. If we had used scoped or transient, each component would get its own instance, defeating the purpose of shared state.

---
#### Step 3: Use the Service in Components

##### First Component: Counter Component (Counter.razor)

```c#
@page "/counter"
@inject CounterStateService CounterState

<PageTitle>Counter</PageTitle>

<h1>Counter</h1>

<p role="status">Current count: @CounterState.Count</p>
<button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="IncrementCount">Click me</button>

@code {
    private void IncrementCount()
    {
        CounterState.IncrementCount();
    }
}
```

##### Second Component: Index Component (Index.razor)

```c#
@page "/"
@page "/index"
@page "/home"
@inject CounterStateService CounterState

<p>The counter value is: @CounterState.Count</p>
```

---
### How Does This Work?

- Both `Counter.razor` and `Index.razor` share the same state (`CounterStateService`).
- When the button is clicked in `Counter.razor`, the count updates in both components.
- The service acts as a central store, ensuring that all subscribed components see the latest value.

---
### Key Differences Between Component State and Application State

1. **Component State**:
   - Exists only within a single component.
   - Is lost when the component is removed or reloaded.
   - Is good for temporary UI-related data.

2. **Application State**:
   - Exists globally across multiple components.
   - Persists across navigation.
   - Requires a service and dependency injection.
