Most of what happens in the `<Router>` component is hidden behind the scenes, making it unclear how Blazor finds Razor components and when it processes routing. Let's break it down deeply.

---
## 1. When Does the Router Work?
Blazor's `<Router>` component is always running, but it triggers in these cases:

### 1.1. On Initial Page Load:
- When `_Host.cshtml` loads Blazor, `App.razor` executes immediately.
- The `<Router>` inspects the requested URL and matches it with available routes.

### 1.2. On Navigation (`<NavLink>` or `NavigationManager.NavigateTo()`):
- If a user clicks a `<NavLink>` or a component calls `NavigationManager.NavigateTo("/counter")`, the `<Router>` intercepts it before the browser requests a new page.
- The `<Router>` updates the displayed component without a full page reload.

### 1.3. On Direct URL Entry:
- If a user manually enters a URL (e.g., `/counter`), the `<Router>` still intercepts it and finds the right component.

## 2. How Does `<Router>` Find All Razor Pages?

The key part of the `<Router>` component is the `AppAssembly` attribute:

``` c#
<Router AppAssembly="@typeof(App).Assembly">
```

This tells the `<Router>` where to look for all available pages.

### What Happens Internally?

#### Reflection Scans the Assembly:
- The Blazor runtime uses **reflection** on the `AppAssembly` (typically the main application assembly) to find all `.razor` components marked with the `@page` directive.
- Any `.razor` file that contains `@page "/some-route"` is recognized as a **routable component**.

#### Stores Route-Component Mappings:
- Blazor builds a **dictionary** of routes → components. For example:

```csharp
{
    "/": typeof(Index),
    "/counter": typeof(Counter),
    "/fetchdata": typeof(FetchData)
}
```

- This dictionary is how the `<Router>` knows which component to render when a specific URL is requested.

## 3. How Does `<Router>` Render the Right Component?

The `<Router>` uses the `<Found>` and `<RouteView>` components to render the correct Razor component when a route matches:

```c#
<Found Context="routeData">
    <RouteView RouteData="@routeData" DefaultLayout="@typeof(MainLayout)" />
    <FocusOnNavigate RouteData="@routeData" Selector="h1" />
</Found>
```

### What Happens Here?
- If the requested URL matches a known route, the `<Router>` passes the `routeData` to `<RouteView>`.

- `<RouteView>`:
  - Loads the correct Razor component.
  - Wraps it inside the specified layout (e.g., `MainLayout`).

### Example:
- User navigates to `/counter`.
- `<Router>` finds `Counter.razor` via the route-component dictionary.
- `<RouteView>` renders `<Counter />` inside `<MainLayout />`.

---
## 4. What If No Route Matches?

If the requested URL doesn’t match any route, the `<NotFound>` section is executed:

```c#
<NotFound>
    <PageTitle>Not found</PageTitle>
    <LayoutView Layout="@typeof(MainLayout)">
        <p role="alert">Sorry, there's nothing at this address.</p>
    </LayoutView>
</NotFound>
```

### What Happens Here?
- The `<NotFound>` block is triggered.
- A **404 page** is displayed, wrapped inside the `MainLayout`.
- This ensures a consistent user experience even when a route is invalid.

``` c#
<Router AppAssembly="@typeof(App).Assembly">
    <Found Context="routeData">
        <RouteView RouteData="@routeData" DefaultLayout="@typeof(MainLayout)" />
        <FocusOnNavigate RouteData="@routeData" Selector="h1" />
    </Found>
    <NotFound>
        <PageTitle>Not found</PageTitle>
        <LayoutView Layout="@typeof(MainLayout)">
            <p role="alert">Sorry, there's nothing at this address.</p>
        </LayoutView>
    </NotFound>
</Router>
```
