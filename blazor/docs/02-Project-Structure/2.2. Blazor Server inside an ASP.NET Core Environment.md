Blazor Server is not a standalone framework—it runs inside an ASP.NET Core application. While Blazor replaces traditional Razor Pages and MVC Views for UI rendering, the project itself is still an ASP.NET Core application.

To clarify this process, let’s go step by step.

### 1. How Blazor Server Runs in an ASP.NET Core Environment

Blazor Server relies on ASP.NET Core for:
- **Hosting**: Handling HTTP requests and routing.
- **Middleware & Services**: Dependency Injection, Authentication, etc.
- **Entry Point Setup**: `_Host.cshtml` acts as the entry point.
- **Real-Time Communication**: SignalR WebSockets enable dynamic UI updates.

#### Difference Between MVC (Razor Pages) and Blazor Server

| **Feature**      | **MVC (Razor Pages)**                                                                | **Blazor Server**                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **How it works** | The server generates an HTML page and sends it to the browser.                       | The server renders the UI in real-time and sends updates via SignalR (WebSockets). |
| **Updates**      | Full page reloads. User interactions trigger a new request → server re-renders HTML. | Only the changed parts of the UI are updated dynamically without a full reload.    |
| **Example**      | Clicking a button reloads the page with new content.                                 | Clicking a button updates only a small part of the page instantly.                 |
#### Key Difference
- **MVC (Razor Pages)**: Static HTML with full page reloads.
- **Blazor Server**: Dynamic UI updates with no page reloads (uses WebSockets).

### 2. Key Parts of an ASP.NET Core Blazor Server Project
The Blazor Server app consists of ASP.NET Core components that make it work. These include:

#### (A) **Program.cs** - Configuring the ASP.NET Core App
Blazor Server apps start from `Program.cs`, just like any ASP.NET Core project.

**Example `Program.cs`:**
```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services.AddRazorPages();   // Required for _Host.cshtml
builder.Services.AddServerSideBlazor(); // Enables Blazor Server

var app = builder.Build();

app.UseStaticFiles();
app.UseRouting();
app.MapBlazorHub();  // Enables Blazor real-time connection (SignalR)
app.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");  // Redirects all unknown routes to Blazor

app.Run();
```

**What happens here?**
- ASP.NET Core starts and registers services.
- `AddServerSideBlazor()` allows Blazor to run inside the app.
- `MapBlazorHub()` enables real-time WebSocket communication using SignalR.
- `MapFallbackToPage("/_Host")` ensures all unknown routes load `_Host.cshtml`.

#### (B) **_Host.cshtml** - The Bridge Between ASP.NET and Blazor

```c#
@page "/"
@namespace PortfolioApp.Pages
@addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers
@{
    Layout = "_Layout.cshtml";
}

<component type="typeof(App)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />
```

`_Host.cshtml` is an ASP.NET Core Razor Page, but it plays a special role in Blazor Server apps. It acts as the starting point where Blazor takes over and renders the app.

**Breaking it Down:**

1. **`@page "/"`**
   - This makes `_Host.cshtml` the first page loaded when the user visits `/` (the root URL).
   - In traditional MVC, Razor Pages use `.cshtml` files, but here, `_Host.cshtml` loads Blazor.

2. **`Layout = "_Layout.cshtml";`**
   - `_Host.cshtml` uses `_Layout.cshtml` as the main layout (for things like a navbar, styles, and scripts).
   - `_Layout.cshtml` is similar to MVC layouts and defines the basic HTML structure.

3. **`<component type="typeof(App)" render-mode="ServerPrerendered" />`**
   - This loads the Blazor app inside `_Host.cshtml`.
   - It tells Blazor to start rendering `App.razor`, which manages the app’s routing and pages.
   - `render-mode="ServerPrerendered"` means the page is pre-rendered on the server before interactive Blazor updates begin.

### Combined Process Overview

1. **Program.cs**:
   - This is where the app starts.
   - It configures the services and routing for your Blazor Server app.

2. **_Host.cshtml**:
   - When you visit the app, `_Host.cshtml` is the first page loaded.
   - This is an ASP.NET Razor Page that bridges the ASP.NET Core MVC and Blazor.
   - Inside `_Host.cshtml`, it specifies that the layout should be `_Layout.cshtml` (which is your common HTML structure like a navbar, footer, etc.).
   - The Blazor app (`App.razor`) is then loaded inside this page, and Blazor starts managing the client-side UI.

3. **_Layout.cshtml**:
   - This is the shared layout for the app.
   - It defines the basic structure (like `<head>`, `<nav>`, and other global elements) and includes a placeholder for the content to be displayed.
   - Any page rendered (including `Index.razor`) will use this layout unless specified otherwise.

4. **App.razor**:
   - This is where Blazor’s routing is defined.
   - It listens for URL changes (like `/`, `/fetchdata`, etc.) and renders the appropriate Razor Component (like `Index.razor`).
   - When the app is first loaded (on `/`), it will render `Index.razor` as the default page.

5. **Index.razor**:
   - The default page for `/` is typically `Index.razor`. This is where the main content for the root of the app appears.
   - This page is displayed within the layout specified in `_Host.cshtml` (which is `_Layout.cshtml`).
