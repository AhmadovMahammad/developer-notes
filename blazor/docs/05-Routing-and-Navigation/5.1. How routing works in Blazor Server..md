Routing in Blazor Server determines how user requests are mapped to components. Unlike traditional web applications that rely on full-page reloads for navigation, Blazor Server handles routing entirely on the client side, using SignalR to maintain a persistent connection. When a user navigates to a new page, Blazor does not reload the browser. Instead, it updates the UI dynamically while maintaining the current state.

## How Blazor's `<Router>` Works Under the Hood

Most of what happens in `<Router>` is hidden behind the scenes, making it unclear how Blazor finds Razor components and when it processes routing. Let's break it down deeply.

---
### When Does the Router Work?

Blazor's `<Router>` component is always running, but it triggers in these cases:

1. **On Initial Page Load**:
   - When `_Host.cshtml` loads Blazor, `App.razor` executes immediately.
   - `<Router>` inspects the requested URL and matches it with available routes.

2. **On Navigation (`<NavLink>` or `NavigationManager.NavigateTo()`)**:
   - If a user clicks a `<NavLink>` or a component calls `NavigationManager.NavigateTo("/counter")`, `<Router>` intercepts it before the browser requests a new page.
   - The `<Router>` updates the displayed component without a full page reload.

3. **On Direct URL Entry**:
   - If a user manually enters a URL (e.g., `/counter`), `<Router>` still intercepts it and finds the right component.

### How Does `<Router>` Find All Razor Pages?

The key part is `AppAssembly="@typeof(App).Assembly"`, which tells `<Router>` where to look for all available pages.

#### What Happens Internally?

1. **Reflection Scans the Assembly**:
   - The Blazor runtime uses reflection on the `App` assembly to find all `.razor` components marked with `@page`.
   - Any `.razor` file that contains `@page "/some-route"` is recognized as a routable component.

2. **Stores Route-Component Mappings**:
   - Blazor builds a dictionary of routes → components.

Example:
```csharp
{
	 "/": typeof(Index),
	 "/counter": typeof(Counter),
	 "/fetchdata": typeof(FetchData)
}
```
This is how `<Router>` knows which component to render when a URL is requested.

---
### How Does `<Router>` Render the Right Component?

```C#
<Found Context="routeData">
    <RouteView RouteData="@routeData" DefaultLayout="@typeof(MainLayout)" />
    <FocusOnNavigate RouteData="@routeData" Selector="h1" />
</Found>
```

If the requested URL matches a known route, `<Router>` passes it to `<RouteView>`.

- **Loads the correct Razor component**.
- **Wraps it inside the layout (`MainLayout`)**.

#### Example:

- User navigates to `/counter`.
- `<Router>` finds `Counter.razor` via the dictionary.
- `<RouteView>` renders `<Counter />` inside `<MainLayout />`.

---
### What If No Route Matches?

```C#
<NotFound>
    <PageTitle>Not found</PageTitle>
    <LayoutView Layout="@typeof(MainLayout)">
        <p role="alert">Sorry, there's nothing at this address.</p>
    </LayoutView>
</NotFound>
```

If the requested URL doesn’t match any route, `<NotFound>` runs. A 404 page is shown inside `MainLayout`.

---
### Multiple Routes for a Single Component

A component can have multiple route templates by using multiple `@page` directives.

```C#
@page "/home"
@page "/index"

<h3>Welcome Page</h3>
<p>This page is accessible via both /home and /index.</p>
```

Now, both `/home` and `/index` will display the same component.

---
### Redirecting Users Programmatically

Sometimes, we need to redirect users to another page based on an event (e.g., after form submission). Blazor provides `NavigationManager` to handle this.

```C#
@inject NavigationManager Navigation

<button @onclick="GoToDashboard">Click me to open Dashboard</button>

@code {
    private void GoToDashboard()
    {
        Navigation.NavigateTo("/dashboard");
    }
}
```

When the button is clicked, Blazor redirects the user to `/dashboard` without a full-page reload.
