The `@page` directive is what makes a Blazor component routable. Without `@page`, a component cannot be accessed directly via a URL.

At first glance, `@page` just looks like a way to set the route, but there is more to it than that. It registers the component within Blazor’s routing system and allows Blazor to handle URL-based navigation without a full page reload.

We covered a basic introduction in the previous question about how `App.razor` finds and reloads components with the `@page` directive.

## Routes Are Matched Exactly (No Wildcards)

Blazor does not support wildcard (`*`) routes like traditional ASP.NET MVC. Every route must be explicitly defined using `@page`.

For example, this won't work:

```c#
@page "/products/*" // Invalid: Wildcards are not supported
```

Instead, Blazor provides route parameters, which allow dynamic routing (covered later).

---
## What Happens If Two Components Have the Same `@page` Route?

If two components are assigned the same `@page` directive, Blazor will throw an error at runtime because it cannot determine which one should be loaded.

For example:

```c#
// Component 1
@page "/profile"

<h3>Profile Page 1</h3>

// Component 2
@page "/profile"

<h3>Profile Page 2</h3>
```

Blazor will not allow this because both components are mapped to `/profile`. You must ensure each route is unique.

---
## `@page` Must Be at the Top of the Component

Blazor requires `@page` to be the first directive in the component.

If `@page` is not the first directive, Blazor will not recognize the route, and the component won’t be accessible via the browser.

### Correct Usage:

```c#
@page "/about"
@using MyApp.Components

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>Welcome to the About page!</p>
```

### Incorrect Usage:

```c#
@using MyApp.Components
@page "/about" // This will not work because @page is not the first directive

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>Welcome to the About page!</p>
```

In the incorrect example, Blazor will not recognize the `/about` route, and the component will not be accessible via the browser.
