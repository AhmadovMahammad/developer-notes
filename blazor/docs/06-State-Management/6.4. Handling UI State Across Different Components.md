In a Blazor Server application, handling UI state across different components is crucial to ensure that the UI is consistent, responsive, and reflects the current state of the application.

Unlike traditional single-page applications where each page has its own lifecycle and state, Blazor Server uses a server-side rendering model, where the UI components are rendered and managed on the server, and the changes are sent over a SignalR connection to the client. This means that UI state management is not only about keeping track of data but also ensuring that UI-related state transitions are consistent and propagated throughout the app.

## Understanding UI State Across Components

UI state refers to the visual and interactive aspects of a component or application that can change dynamically. This can include:

- **Visual State**: Things like whether a button is highlighted, whether a modal is visible, or whether an item is selected in a list.
- **Interactive State**: Actions taken by the user, such as input values in a form, toggle switches, or whether a checkbox is checked.
- **Component Rendering State**: If certain components should or should not be displayed based on conditions, or if some components need to be updated when shared state changes.

In Blazor, the goal is to handle UI state in a way that ensures that:

- **Consistency**: The UI reflects the current data and interactions across the entire application.
- **Performance**: The UI does not re-render unnecessarily, which can negatively impact performance.
- **Seamlessness**: The user experience is smooth, with state transitions that do not disrupt the flow of interaction.

## Solutions for Handling UI State Across Components

### 1. Using Services for Shared UI State

A common and effective approach to managing UI state across different components is by using services that manage and share the state. By injecting a service into multiple components, the UI state can be shared across all of them. A state service can hold information that controls the visibility, active status, or other visual aspects of the components.

#### Example: Shared Modal State
Imagine you have a modal component that can be shown or hidden based on a global state. You want to control the visibility of the modal across different components.

1. **Service Definition**: Create a service that manages the modal visibility state.

```csharp
public class ModalStateService
{
    public bool IsModalVisible { get; private set; }

    public event Action? OnModalVisibilityChanged;

    public void ToggleVisibility()
    {
        IsModalVisible = !IsModalVisible;
        OnModalVisibilityChanged?.Invoke();
    }
}
```

2. **Register the Service**: Add the service in `Program.cs` so that it is available globally.

```csharp
builder.Services.AddSingleton<ModalStateService>();
```

3. **Component that Uses the Modal State**: The component that displays the modal will listen to changes in the service.

```c#
@inject ModalStateService ModalState

@if (ModalState.IsModalVisible)
{
    <div>
        <h3>Modal Content</h3>
        <button @onclick="()=> ToggleModal(false)">Close</button>
    </div>
}
else
{
    <button @onclick="()=> ToggleModal(true)">Show Modal</button>
}

@code {
    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        ModalState.OnModalVisibilityChanged += async () =>
        {
            await InvokeAsync(StateHasChanged);
        };
    }

    private void ToggleModal(bool visibility)
    {
        switch (visibility)
        {
            case true:
                ModalState.ShowModal();
                break;

            case false:
                ModalState.HideModal();
                break;
        }
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        ModalState.OnModalVisibilityChanged -= StateHasChanged;
    }
}
```

```csharp
public class ModalStateService
{
    public bool IsModalVisible { get; private set; }
    public event Action? OnModalVisibilityChanged;

    public void ShowModal()
    {
        IsModalVisible = true;
        NotifyStateChanged();
    }

    public void HideModal()
    {
        IsModalVisible = false;
        NotifyStateChanged();
    }

    private void NotifyStateChanged() => OnModalVisibilityChanged?.Invoke();
}
```

- The modal component listens for changes in the `ModalStateService`.
- It subscribes to the `OnModalVisibilityChanged` event to trigger a re-render whenever the modal visibility state changes.
- When the modal is closed, it calls `HideModal` from the service, which updates the state and triggers the UI update.

4. **Triggering Modal Visibility from Another Component**: Any component can trigger the modal by calling the service methods.

```c#
@inject ModalStateService ModalStateService

<button @onclick="ShowModal">Show Modal</button>

@code {
    private void ShowModal()
    {
        ModalStateService.ShowModal();
    }
}
```

With this setup, the modal can be controlled globally by any component that injects the `ModalStateService`, and the UI state will be shared and synchronized across the components.

### 2. Using Cascading Values for UI State Propagation

Cascading values can be used when you need to propagate UI state from a parent component to its descendants. Instead of passing UI state explicitly via parameters, the parent component can "cascade" values down to all its child components, making it easy to share state without requiring explicit passing of parameters.

#### Example: Cascading Values in `MainLayout.razor`

```c#
@inherits LayoutComponentBase

<CascadingValue Value="loggedInUser" Name="username">
    <CascadingValue Value="isAdmin" Name="isAdmin">
        <div class="sidebar">
            <NavMenu />
        </div>
    </CascadingValue>
</CascadingValue>

@code {
    private string loggedInUser = "Mahammad Ahmadov";
    private bool isAdmin = true;
}
```

#### Example: Using Cascading Values in `NavMenu.razor`

```c#
<div class="nav-item px-3" style="color:white;">
    @username
</div>

@code {
    [CascadingParameter(Name = "username")] public string username { get; set; } = string.Empty;
}
```

### Notes about Cascading Values

Blazor matches cascading parameters by type, not by name. This means that even if different components use different property names, Blazor will still bind them correctly as long as they have the same type.

---
#### Example 1: Different Property Names, Same Type

**Parent Component (MainLayout.razor)**

```c#
<CascadingValue Value="themeClass">
    <button @onclick="ToggleTheme">Toggle Theme</button>
    <div class="@themeClass content px-4">
        @Body
    </div>
</CascadingValue>

@code {
    private string themeClass = "light-theme";

    private void ToggleTheme()
    {
        themeClass = themeClass == "light-theme" ? "dark-theme" : "light-theme";
    }
}
```

The `CascadingValue` passes `themeClass` (string type) down the component tree.

**Child Component (Index.razor)**

```c#
@page "/"

<CascadingParameter] public string? MyTheme { get; set; }

<h3>Home Page</h3>
<p>Current theme: @MyTheme</p>
```

Even though the property name is different (`MyTheme` instead of `themeClass`), Blazor automatically assigns the cascading value because the type is `string`.

**Another Child Component (Dashboard.razor)**

```c#
@page "/dashboard"

<CascadingParameter] public string? ActiveTheme { get; set; }

<h3>Dashboard Page</h3>
<p>The current theme in Dashboard is: @ActiveTheme</p>
```

Again, the name (`ActiveTheme`) is different, but Blazor correctly assigns the theme value.

---
#### Example 2: How to Differentiate Multiple Values of the Same Type?

Blazor allows you to name cascading values using the `Name` parameter. Child components can then use `[CascadingParameter(Name = "NameHere")]` to select a specific one.

```c#
<CascadingValue Name="Primary" Value="Dark">
    <CascadingValue Name="Secondary" Value="Light">
        <ChildComponent />
    </CascadingValue>
</CascadingValue>

@code {
    [CascadingParameter(Name = "Primary")] public string? PrimaryTheme { get; set; }
    [CascadingParameter(Name = "Secondary")] public string? SecondaryTheme { get; set; }
}

<h3>Child Component</h3>
<p>Primary Theme: @PrimaryTheme</p>
<p>Secondary Theme: @SecondaryTheme</p>
```

### 3. Using Local Component State for Individual UI Elements

In some cases, UI state needs to be localized to a single component, for example, tracking whether a button is pressed or whether a form input is focused. For such cases, you can simply manage state within the component itself.

```c#
<button @onclick="ToggleButtonState" class="@ButtonClass">Toggle</button>

@code {
    private bool _isActive = false;

    private void ToggleButtonState()
    {
        _isActive = !_isActive;
    }

    private string ButtonClass => _isActive ? "btn-active" : "btn-inactive";
}
```

In this example, the button's state is managed locally within the component, and the class is toggled based on whether the button is active or inactive.
