Blazor components are the essential building blocks of a Blazor application. They are self-contained units that manage a part of the user interface and its behavior. Components allow developers to build interactive, dynamic web applications using C# code and HTML markup, all in one file.

Blazor components are similar to UI elements or widgets. For example, a component could be something like a button, a form, a navigation menu, or even a complete page in your application.

## Key Characteristics of Blazor Components

1. **Modular and Reusable**: Components allow you to split your UI into smaller pieces that are easier to maintain and test. You can reuse components in different parts of your app.
2. **Encapsulated Logic and UI**: Each component can manage its own logic (like handling events, processing data) and its own UI (HTML structure).
3. **Interactive**: Blazor components are dynamic and can handle user interactions like clicks, form submissions, and updates.
4. **Dynamic Rendering**: Components can automatically re-render when their state changes. Blazor uses a process called reconciliation to efficiently update the UI when data changes.
5. **Built-in Support for Parameters**: Components can accept parameters, which allows you to pass data to them. This allows greater flexibility, making components more configurable.

## Structure of a Blazor Component

A Blazor component typically resides in a `.razor` file. The `.razor` file combines both HTML (for UI) and C# code (for logic) in one file. This is one of the defining features of Blazor: mixing markup and logic together.

A basic Blazor component can look like this:

```c#
@code {
    private string message = "Hello, Blazor!";
}

<h3>@message</h3>
<button @onclick="ChangeMessage">Click Me</button>

@code {
    private void ChangeMessage()
    {
        message = "You clicked the button!";
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **@code Block**: This is where you write your C# code (logic) for the component. The `@code { }` block is used to define variables, methods, event handlers, and other logic for your component.
2. **Markup**: The HTML part is simple and can include standard tags like `<h3>`, `<button>`, etc. This defines what will be rendered on the screen.
3. **Data Binding**: `@message` is data binding. The value of `message` from the `@code` block will be displayed in the HTML. One-way binding
4. **Event Handling**: `@onclick="ChangeMessage"` binds the button's click event to the `ChangeMessage` method in the `@code` block. When the button is clicked, the method will run, updating the `message` variable.

## What Happens Behind the Scenes?

1. **Initial Rendering**: When the component first loads, the Blazor framework will render the UI (HTML part) and execute any code in the `@code` block.
2. **User Interaction**: When the user clicks the button, the `@onclick` directive tells Blazor to execute the `ChangeMessage()` method in the C# code.
3. **State Change**: The `ChangeMessage()` method updates the value of `message`. Since Blazor components are stateful, when the state of the component changes (like `message` changing), the UI is automatically re-rendered.
4. **Efficient Re-rendering**: Blazor will update only the parts of the UI that need to be changed, so in this case, it will only update the text inside the `<h3>` tag.

## Parameters in Blazor Components

Blazor components can accept parameters, which means you can pass data to a component when you use it. For example, you can pass a title to a component like this:

```c#
<!-- Parent Component -->
<TestComponent Title="Called from Index Razor" />

<!-- Child Component -->
@code {
    private string message = "Hello, Blazor!";
}

<h2>title from parent: @Title</h2>
<h3>@message</h3>
<button @onclick="ChangeMessage">Click Me</button>

@code {
    [Parameter] public string Title { get; set; } = string.Empty;

    private void ChangeMessage()
    {
        message = "You clicked the button!";
    }
}
```

- **@Parameter Attribute**: In the child component, the `Title` property is marked with the `[Parameter]` attribute. This tells Blazor that the property should receive its value from the parent component.
- **Component Usage**: In the parent component, we pass the `Title` parameter when using `<TestComponent Title="Called from Index Razor" />`.
