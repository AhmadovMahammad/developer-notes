Blazor Server is a web framework developed by Microsoft that allows developers to build interactive web applications using C# and .NET instead of JavaScript. In Blazor Server, the application runs on the server, and the client (typically a browser) only handles rendering the UI.

Here's how it works:

- When a user interacts with the Blazor Server application (e.g., clicks a button or fills out a form), the event is sent to the server.
- The server processes the event and computes the necessary changes to the UI or application state.
- After processing, the server sends the updated UI components back to the client over a real-time, persistent connection maintained by SignalR.
- SignalR is a real-time web communication library that allows continuous, bi-directional communication between the server and client. It ensures that the UI on the client is kept up-to-date without requiring full page reloads.

This design allows Blazor Server applications to be developed using C# for both client-side and server-side code, streamlining development and reducing the need for JavaScript. However, because the app runs on the server and requires constant communication with the client, network latency and performance can be factors to consider.
