# Blazor Server - Roadmap

This repository exists to provide a structured and thorough learning journey for beginners who want to master Blazor Server. After noticing that most available resources either come from creators with advanced knowledge or from brief, overly simplified explanations, it became clear that there was a gap for comprehensive, accessible content.

The goal of this roadmap is to help developers understand how Blazor Server works "under the hood" by breaking down the concepts and practices in a clear and logical progression. By following this guide, developers will build a strong foundation in Blazor Server, covering everything from the basics of components and routing to more advanced topics like SignalR integration and performance optimization.

Whether you’re building your first Blazor Server application or you’re looking to improve your skills, this roadmap will serve as a go-to reference, ensuring you can learn at your own pace without feeling overwhelmed. Happy coding!

- **Creating and using `.razor` components.**
- **Understanding the Razor syntax (`@code`, `@bind`, etc.).**
- **Conditional rendering (`@if`, `@else`) and looping (`@foreach`).**
- **Reusing components and passing parameters.**

## 4. Component Lifecycle in Blazor Server
- **Understanding Blazor component lifecycle.**
- **Lifecycle methods (`OnInitialized`, `OnParametersSet`, `OnAfterRender`).**
- **Handling async operations in lifecycle methods.**
- **Using `StateHasChanged` properly.**

## 5. Routing & Navigation
- **How routing works in Blazor Server.**
- **Using `@page` directive for defining routes.**
- **Navigating between components using `NavLink`.**
- **Handling route parameters.**

## 6. State Management in Blazor Server
- **Understanding component state vs. application state.**
- **Using cascading parameters for state sharing.**
- **Implementing state management with services.**
- **Handling UI state across different components.**

## 7. Dependency Injection (DI) in Blazor Server
- **Understanding DI in Blazor Server.**
- **Registering and injecting services (`Scoped`, `Singleton`, `Transient`).**
- **Using DI to share data between components.**

## 8. Forms & User Input Handling
- **Creating forms with `EditForm`.**
- **Using built-in form components (`InputText`, `InputNumber`, etc.).**
- **Handling form validation using `DataAnnotations`.**
- **Implementing custom validation logic.**

## 9. Calling APIs & Database Interaction
- **Making HTTP requests using `HttpClient`.**
- **Using Entity Framework Core in Blazor Server.**
- **Connecting Blazor Server with a database.**
- **Implementing CRUD operations with EF Core.**

## 10. Authentication & Authorization
- **Implementing authentication in Blazor Server.**
- **Using ASP.NET Core Identity with Blazor Server.**
- **Role-based and claims-based authorization.**
- **Protecting routes and UI elements based on user roles.**

## 11. Real-Time Features & SignalR in Blazor Server
- **How Blazor Server uses SignalR for real-time updates.**
- **Using SignalR to push live updates to the UI.**
- **Implementing a real-time chat or dashboard with SignalR.**

## 12. Performance Optimization
- **Reducing latency in Blazor Server apps.**
- **Efficiently managing UI updates to prevent excessive re-renders.**
- **Using `RenderFragment` and virtualization for large data sets.**
- **Optimizing SignalR communication.**

## 13. Advanced Features & Customization
- **Creating custom components with parameters and events.**
- **Implementing authorization policies and claims.**
- **Handling large-scale Blazor Server applications.**
- **Using Blazor Server with microservices architecture.**

## 14. Final Project: Apply Everything You Learned
- **Build a fully functional Blazor Server application.**
- **Implement authentication, real-time updates, and database integration.**
- **Optimize performance and ensure proper state management.**
- **Deploy the application to Azure or other hosting services.**
