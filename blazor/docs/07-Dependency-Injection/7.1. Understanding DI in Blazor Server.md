Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used in software development to achieve loose coupling between components. Instead of components creating their own dependencies (which makes code tightly coupled and harder to maintain), dependencies are injected from an external source.

Blazor Server follows the built-in DI system of ASP.NET Core, meaning we can register services at application startup and inject them into any component or service that requires them.

---
## Why is DI Important in Blazor Server?

In Blazor Server, UI interactions happen on the server, and components frequently re-render as users interact with the app. Without DI:

1. **Each component would create its own instance of a service**, leading to unnecessary memory consumption.
2. **State would not persist across components**, causing issues like users losing form data or session information.
3. **Code would be harder to maintain**, as changing the implementation of a service would require updating multiple components.

By using DI, Blazor ensures that components receive the same instance of a service where needed, making applications more efficient and scalable.

---
## How DI Works in Blazor Server

At a high level, Blazor DI works as follows:

1. **Service Registration**: In `Program.cs`, we register services with specific lifetimes (Transient, Scoped, or Singleton).
2. **Service Injection**: Components request services using `@inject` (Razor syntax) or `[Inject]` (C# property injection).
3. **Blazor Provides the Service**: The DI container supplies the requested service instance based on its lifetime.

## Step-by-Step Implementation of DI in Blazor Server

### 1. Registering a Service

Before injecting a service into a component, we must register it in `Program.cs`. The DI system supports three service lifetimes:

- **Transient**: A new instance is created every time the service is requested.
- **Scoped**: A single instance is created per user connection (useful for user-specific data).
- **Singleton**: A single instance is shared across all users.

Let's register a simple `UserService` as Scoped:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddScoped<UserService>();
```

By adding `builder.Services.AddScoped<UserService>();`, we are telling Blazor to create one instance per user session and share it across components.

---
### 2. Creating a Service Class

Next, let’s create a service that stores and manages user-related state:

```csharp
public class UserService
{
    private int _nextId;

    private readonly Dictionary<int, string> _users = new()
    {
        { 0, "Mahammad Ahmadov" },
        { 1, "Lagertha" },
        { 2, "Bjorn Ironside" }
    };

    public event Action? OnUserChanged;

    public string GetUser(int id)
    {
        return _users[id];
    }

    public string GetCurrentUser()
    {
        return _users[_nextId];
    }

    public void SetCurrentUser(string name)
    {
        _nextId = _users.Count;
        _users.Add(++_nextId, name);
        OnUserChanged?.Invoke();
    }

    public IEnumerable<string> GetUsers()
    {
        return _users.Values;
    }

    public void AddUser(int id, string name)
    {
        _users.Add(id, name);
    }

    public void RemoveUser(int id)
    {
        _users.Remove(id);
    }

    public void UpdateUser(int id, string name)
    {
        _users[id] = name;
    }

    public bool UserExists(int id)
    {
        return _users.ContainsKey(id);
    }

    public bool UserExists(string name)
    {
        return _users.ContainsValue(name);
    }

    public int GetUserCount()
    {
        return _users.Count;
    }

    public void ClearUsers()
    {
        _users.Clear();
    }
}
```

---
### 3. Injecting the Service into a Component

Now that `UserService` is registered in DI, we can inject it into a Blazor component using `@inject` or `[Inject]`.

#### Example: Using DI in a Component (UserDisplay.razor)

```c#
@page "/userdisplay"
@inject UserService UserService

<h2>User List</h2>

@if (users is not null && users.Any())
{
    <ul class="user-list">
        @foreach (var user in users)
        {
            <li>@user</li>
        }
    </ul>
}
else
{
    <p>No users available.</p>
}

<div class="user-form">
    <input type="text" @bind="newUserName" placeholder="Enter username..." />
    <button @onclick="AddUser">Add User</button>
</div>

@code {
    private List<string> users = [];
    private string newUserName = string.Empty;

    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        users = UserService.GetUsers().ToList();
    }

    private void AddUser()
    {
        if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(newUserName))
        {
            UserService.SetCurrentUser(newUserName);
            users = UserService.GetUsers().ToList();
            newUserName = string.Empty;
        }
    }
}
```

#### Understanding What Happens Here

- **Dependency Injection in Action**: The `UserService` instance is injected using `@inject UserService UserService`.
- **Data Persistence Across Components**: If another component also injects `UserService`, it will see the updated current user.

---
### 4. Using the Same Service in Another Component

Since `UserService` is registered as Scoped, all components within the same user session share the same instance. Let's inject it into another component like a navigation menu.

#### Example: Displaying the User Name in a Navigation Menu (NavMenu.razor)

```c#
@inject UserService UserService

<div class="nav-item px-3" style="color:white;">
    Welcome, @UserService.GetCurrentUser()
</div>

@code {
    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        UserService.OnUserChanged += StateHasChanged;
    }
}
```

Now, when a user updates their name in `UserDisplay.razor`, the updated value will automatically be reflected in `NavMenu.razor`, since both components share the same `UserService` instance.

---
## What Happens Behind the Scenes?

1. **Blazor Starts the App** → Services are registered in `Program.cs`.
2. **User Visits `/user` Page** → `UserDisplay.razor` injects `UserService` and displays the user’s name.
3. **User Updates Their Name** → The `SetUserName()` method updates the shared `UserService`.
4. **Another Component Uses `UserService`** → `NavMenu.razor` also reflects the new user name automatically.
