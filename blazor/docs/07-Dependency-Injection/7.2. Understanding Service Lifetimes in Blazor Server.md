## What is Dependency Injection?

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern to manage dependencies between classes. Itâ€™s a way to supply an object (i.e., dependency) to a class instead of the class creating the object itself. By controlling the lifecycle of objects, DI helps you optimize resources, improve testability, and make your code more flexible.

By using DI, you decouple the creation of dependencies from their usage, leading to code that is more modular and testable.

Dependency Injection has three service lifetimes: **Singleton**, **Scoped**, and **Transient**.

## 1. Transient Services

### How It Works

A transient service is created every time it is injected into a component or another service. This means that whenever a component requests a transient service, a new instance of that service is created.

### When to Use?
- When you need a fresh instance of a service each time it's used.
- When the service does not need to maintain state.
- When dealing with lightweight services (e.g., generating random numbers, temporary calculations).

### Potential Issues
- **Unnecessary object creation**: If a service is expensive to create and used frequently, this could cause performance overhead.
- **No state retention**: Since a new instance is created each time, any stored data will be lost after each request.

---
## 2. Scoped Services

### How It Works

A scoped service is created once per user session (circuit). In Blazor Server, a circuit is a persistent connection between the client and server, established via SignalR. When a user connects to the application, a new instance of a scoped service is created and maintained for that user until they disconnect.

### When to Use?
- When you need to retain state for a single user session.
- When a service holds user-specific data (e.g., authentication state, shopping cart, form data).
- When working with Entity Framework Core (`DbContext`) in Blazor Server (since it should be scoped to the request/session).

### Potential Issues
- **Memory leaks**: If a scoped service references large objects and is never properly disposed of, it can cause memory leaks over time.
- **Not shared across circuits**: If a user opens multiple tabs, each tab might have a separate instance of the scoped service.

---
## 3. Singleton Services

### How It Works

A singleton service is created once and shared across the entire application lifetime. This means that all users and all components share the same instance of the service.

### When to Use?
- When a service needs to persist for the entire application lifetime.
- When dealing with application-wide state, such as logging, caching, configuration settings, or global event handling.
- When you want to reduce the cost of creating new instances (e.g., maintaining an expensive database connection pool).

### Potential Issues
- **Data conflicts**: Since the same instance is shared across users, modifications by one user affect all users.
- **Thread safety**: Since multiple users can modify the same instance, race conditions may occur if the service is not properly handled.
- **Caching issues**: If a singleton caches data that changes frequently, users might see outdated information.

## Code Examples for Each Lifetime

In Blazor Server, services are typically registered in `Program.cs`:

```csharp
// Register services with different lifetimes
builder.Services.AddTransient<ITransientService, TransientService>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<IScopedService, ScopedService>();
builder.Services.AddSingleton<ISingletonService, SingletonService>();
```

---
### 1. Transient Service

```csharp
public interface ITransientService
{
    string GetGuid();
}

public class TransientService : ITransientService
{
    private readonly string _guid = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();

    public string GetGuid()
    {
        return _guid;
    }
}
```

Every component that injects this service will get a new GUID.

---
### 2. Scoped Service

```csharp
public interface IScopedService
{
    string GetGuid();
}

public class ScopedService : IScopedService
{
    private readonly string _guid = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();

    public string GetGuid()
    {
        return _guid;
    }
}
```

A user will get the same GUID as long as their session (circuit) remains open.

---
### 3. Singleton Service

```csharp
public interface ISingletonService
{
    string GetGuid();
}

public class SingletonService : ISingletonService
{
    private readonly string _guid = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();

    public string GetGuid()
    {
        return _guid;
    }
}
```

All users and all components will see the same GUID because it's a shared instance.

## Testing the Services in a Blazor Component

```c#
@page "/services"
@using PortfolioApp.Lifecycle
@inject ITransientService TransientService
@inject IScopedService ScopedService
@inject ISingletonService SingletonService

<h2>Service Lifetime Demo</h2>

<p><strong>Transient Service GUID:</strong> @TransientService.GetGuid()</p>
<p><strong>Scoped Service GUID:</strong> @ScopedService.GetGuid()</p>
<p><strong>Singleton Service GUID:</strong> @SingletonService.GetGuid()</p>

<button @onclick="Refresh">Refresh</button>

@code {
    private void Refresh()
    {
        StateHasChanged(); // Forces component to re-render
    }
}
```

---
### Explanation of Behavior

- **Transient Service**:
  When a component or any service that depends on a Transient service is requested, the system creates a new instance of the service with every request, and therefore it generates a new GUID (or any other data) each time you access it.

  So if you have multiple components that inject `ITransientService`, each of them will get a unique instance with a unique value each time.

- **Scoped Service**:
  A Scoped service is typically shared between components within the same request lifecycle (e.g., page load or session). But, when the page is reloaded (which leads to a new session), the scoped service is recreated with new values, such as a new GUID.

- **Singleton Service**:
  A Singleton service is created once and shared globally across all components. It is only created once for the lifetime of the application, and the same instance is used throughout the entire application (no matter which component requests it).

  If you reload the page, the Singleton instance is preserved (as long as the application is still running), so the same GUID will be used across all components for the entire life of the app.
