When you query data from a database using **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)**, you have the option to use two different types of queries: **Tracking** queries and **No-Tracking** queries. The key difference between these two types of queries lies in how EF Core manages the entity instances retrieved from the database and whether it tracks their changes for future updates or not.

Understanding how each of these query types works is crucial to maximizing performance, particularly when you're building high-performance Blazor Server applications.

## **1. Tracking Queries (Default Behavior)**
By default, when you query data using EF Core, it tracks the entities it retrieves from the database. This is called a **Tracking query**.

> When EF Core retrieves an entity (or entities) from the database, it creates an instance of the entity class (for example, a `User` object) and stores it in its **Change Tracker**. The Change Tracker is responsible for keeping track of any changes made to the entity, so that if you modify the entity and later call `SaveChanges()`, EF Core will know which changes need to be written back to the database.

Tracking is extremely useful in scenarios where you want to modify the data after fetching it. EF Core will automatically detect the changes you make to the objects and save those changes when you call `SaveChanges()`.

##### **How Tracking Works:**

1. **Fetching Data**: When EF Core runs a query, it fetches the data and keeps track of the entities it loads, storing them in the Change Tracker.
    
2. **Modifying Data**: Any changes made to these entities are tracked. For example, if you modify a property (like changing a user’s name), EF Core will detect that change and mark the entity as modified.
    
3. **Saving Changes**: When `SaveChanges()` is called, EF Core generates an SQL statement to update the database with the changes made to the entities.

##### **Example of Tracking Query:**
Here’s how a typical **Tracking query** looks like in EF Core:

``` c#
public List<User> GetUsers()
{
    // Tracking query (default behavior)
    return _context.Users.ToList();
}
```

In this example:

- **`_context.Users.ToList()`** is a **tracking query**. EF Core tracks the `User` objects it retrieves, which means if you change any of these objects later in your code, EF Core will be aware of these changes.

## **2. No-Tracking Queries (AsNoTracking)**

> A **No-Tracking query**, on the other hand, is used when you don't need to track changes to the entities that are returned by the query. This means that EF Core does not store the entities in the **Change Tracker**, which results in improved performance, especially for read-only operations where no updates are needed.

The primary advantage of using **No-Tracking queries** is that they avoid the overhead of tracking the entity’s state, which can significantly improve performance when you don’t need to modify the entities later on.

You can use **No-Tracking queries** by calling **`AsNoTracking()`** on the query, which tells EF Core to bypass the Change Tracker for that query. This reduces memory usage and increases query performance.

##### **When to Use No-Tracking Queries:**

- **Read-Only Operations**: When you are fetching data to display it or perform calculations without modifying it, you don’t need EF Core to track the changes, which makes **No-Tracking queries** ideal.
	
- **Performance Optimization**: For scenarios where you're fetching large sets of data, using **No-Tracking** can speed up the query execution and reduce memory consumption since EF Core doesn’t need to store and manage the entity instances.
    

##### **Example of No-Tracking Query:**
Here’s an example of using **No-Tracking** with **`AsNoTracking()`**:

``` c#
public List<User> GetUsers()
{
    // No-Tracking query (optimized for read-only operations)
    return _context.Users.AsNoTracking().ToList();
}
```

In this case:

- **`_context.Users.AsNoTracking().ToList()`** is a **No-Tracking query**. EF Core does not track the `User` entities it retrieves, making it more efficient for scenarios where you just need to read the data without modification.

### **Performance Considerations**
To understand why **No-Tracking** queries are often more efficient, let's break it down:

1. **Memory Usage**: When EF Core performs a tracking query, it keeps each entity in memory along with its current state (whether it’s modified, deleted, or unchanged). This can consume a significant amount of memory, especially when you retrieve large datasets.

	On the other hand, with **No-Tracking** queries, EF Core doesn’t track the entities, so it doesn’t have to store them in memory for future updates. This can save memory and reduce the load on the system, especially when you’re only fetching data for display purposes.

2. **Speed**: Since EF Core doesn't need to track entities in **No-Tracking queries**, it can execute the query faster. The tracking mechanism adds overhead as EF Core needs to monitor the state of each entity and manage the Change Tracker. This can lead to slower queries, especially in high-volume scenarios. **No-Tracking queries** skip this, resulting in faster query execution.
    
3. **Threading**: When you use **Tracking** queries, EF Core needs to allocate resources to track each entity’s state. For high-concurrency applications (like Blazor Server), this additional overhead can impact server performance. **No-Tracking** queries don’t carry this overhead, leading to better concurrency handling.

### **When to Use Which:**

- **Use Tracking Queries**:
    
    - When you plan to **modify** or **update** the entities retrieved from the database.
        
    - For operations where you want EF Core to automatically detect changes made to entities and track their state.
        
    - For **CRUD operations** where changes need to be saved back to the database.
        
- **Use No-Tracking Queries**:
    
    - When you only need to **read** the data, and you don’t need to make any modifications to the entities.
        
    - For **performance-sensitive scenarios**, especially when dealing with large datasets or when you expect a high volume of read-only operations.
        
    - In **reporting** or **view-only** pages where no changes are expected, as this avoids the overhead of tracking.


## **3. Understanding Entity Tracking & State Management in EF Core**

In EF Core, every entity fetched from the database or added to the `DbContext` is tracked by a system called **Change Tracker**. This mechanism helps EF Core detect changes made to entities and ensures that `SaveChanges()` correctly applies updates, inserts, or deletes to the database.

### 3.1. What is Entity Tracking in EF Core?
When you query an entity using EF Core, it **stores the entity’s original values and its state** in memory. If any changes are made, EF Core can detect them before saving to the database. When you query an entity using EF Core, it **stores the entity’s original values and its state** in memory. If any changes are made, EF Core can detect them before saving to the database.

### **How Does EF Core Track Entities?**
EF Core internally maintains a **dictionary-like data structure** where:

- The **entity itself** is stored.
- The **original values** (before modification) are stored.
- The **current state** (`Unchanged`, `Modified`, `Added`, `Deleted`) is maintained.

This allows EF Core to determine **what changed** when `SaveChanges()` is called.


### 3.2. What is `Entry()` in EF Core?
Each entity being tracked has an **associated entry**, which is an object that holds metadata about that entity.

``` c#
List<User> users = await _context.Users
    .Include(u => u.Profile)
    .ToListAsync();

User user = users.First();

EntityEntry<User> entry = _context.Entry(user);
Console.WriteLine($"state: {entry.State}");
foreach (var item in entry.Properties)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"original value for {item.Metadata.Name}: {item.OriginalValue}");
}
```

``` c#
state: Unchanged  
original value for Id: 1  
original value for Email: dev.ahmadov.mahammad@gmail.com  
original value for Name: Mahammad Ahmadov
```

This `entry` object provides access to:

- The **entity's state** (`entry.State`).
- The **original values** before any changes (`entry.OriginalValues`).
- The **current values** of the entity (`entry.CurrentValues`).


### 3.3. Understanding Entity States in EF Core
An entity in EF Core can have one of the following states:

|**State**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Unchanged`|No modifications were made to the entity since it was loaded.|
|`Modified`|The entity’s properties have been changed.|
|`Added`|The entity is new and should be inserted into the database.|
|`Deleted`|The entity should be removed from the database.|
|`Detached`|The entity is not being tracked by EF Core.|
Since EF Core **only tracks individual entities**, it does **not** provide a direct method to check the states of multiple entities at once. However, we can **loop through the ChangeTracker** and retrieve the states manually.

``` c#
var states = _context.ChangeTracker.Entries<User>()
                     .Select(e => new { e.Entity.Name, e.State })
                     .ToList();
```

This retrieves **all** tracked `User` entities along with their states.

``` c#
private void TestState()
{
    var user = _context.Users.FirstOrDefault(u => u.Id == 1);
    if (user == null) return;

    Console.WriteLine($"Before Change: {user.Name}, State: {_context.Entry(user).State}");

    user.Name = "Updated Name";
    Console.WriteLine($"After Change: {user.Name}, State: {_context.Entry(user).State}");

    var newUser = new User { Name = "Ahmadov", Email = "dev.ahmadov.mahammad@gmail.com" };
    _context.Users.Add(newUser);
    Console.WriteLine($"New User: {newUser.Name}, State: {_context.Entry(newUser).State}");

    foreach (var entry in _context.ChangeTracker.Entries<User>())
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Entity: {entry.Entity.Name}, State: {entry.State}");
    }

    _context.SaveChanges();

    foreach (var entry in _context.ChangeTracker.Entries<User>())
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"After Save - Entity: {entry.Entity.Name}, State: {entry.State}");
    }
}
```

``` c#
Before Change: Mahammad Ahmadov, State: Unchanged  
After Change: Updated Name, State: Modified  
New User: Ahmadov, State: Added  
Entity: Ahmadov, State: Added  
Entity: Updated Name, State: Modified
After Save - Entity: Ahmadov, State: Unchanged  
After Save - Entity: Updated Name, State: Unchanged
```
