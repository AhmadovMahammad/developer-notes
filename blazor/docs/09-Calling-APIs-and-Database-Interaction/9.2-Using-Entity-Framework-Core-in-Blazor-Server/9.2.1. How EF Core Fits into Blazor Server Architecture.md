Entity Framework Core (EF Core) is the Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that allows Blazor Server applications to interact with relational databases using C# objects instead of raw SQL queries.

## Blazor Server Applications vs. Traditional Web Applications

Blazor Server applications are fundamentally different from traditional request-response web applications like ASP.NET MVC or Razor Pages. 

- **Traditional Web Applications**: 
  - A request comes in, the server processes it, and then the response is sent back to the client.
  - The server forgets about the request after processing it.

- **Blazor Server Applications**:
  - The application state is maintained across user interactions.
  - Multiple users can be connected simultaneously, each with an active session.
  - Each user session is long-lived and may require multiple database interactions.
  - Database queries and operations should be efficient to prevent performance bottlenecks.

Because of these differences, handling Entity Framework Core (EF Core) operations requires careful design choices, or else you may run into problems like memory leaks, stale data issues, concurrency conflicts, and poor performance.

## Application State in Blazor Server

### Traditional Web Applications (ASP.NET MVC, API, etc.)
- Every HTTP request is stateless—the server processes the request and then forgets about it.
- The database connection is short-lived, meaning the DbContext is created for the request, used to fetch or modify data, and then disposed of immediately.
- There is no persistent connection between the client and server.

### Blazor Server Applications
- The server maintains a persistent state across interactions using SignalR WebSockets.
- A Blazor component can persist in memory for an extended period, meaning if DbContext is mismanaged, it may stay in memory too long, holding onto resources unnecessarily.
- Database operations are often triggered as part of interactive UI events instead of standard HTTP requests, requiring a different design pattern.

## What Happens If You Inject DbContext Directly Into a Blazor Component?

If you inject DbContext directly into a Blazor component:

- **DbContext Stays in Memory for the Component’s Lifetime**:
  - Since Blazor Server components stay in memory as long as the user interacts with them, the DbContext instance also stays in memory for that duration.
  - Unlike traditional web apps where DbContext is created and disposed of per HTTP request, here it persists as long as the component is active.

- **Multiple Operations Use the Same DbContext Instance**:
  - If the user performs multiple actions (e.g., clicking buttons to fetch or modify data), all of them will reuse the same DbContext instance.
  - Since DbContext is not thread-safe, concurrent database operations can lead to errors.

- **Memory Leaks Due to Tracked Entities**:
  - DbContext tracks entities by default.
  - If a component is kept open for a long time, it may accumulate many tracked entities, leading to high memory consumption.
  - When `SaveChanges()` is called, unexpected updates might occur because old data is still tracked.

---
## Why Using a Service with IDbContextFactory Is Better

- **A Fresh DbContext for Every Operation**:
  - Instead of keeping DbContext alive in memory, the service creates a new DbContext instance for each operation.
  - This mimics how DbContext is used in traditional web applications.

- **Ensures Proper Disposal**:
  - When using `IDbContextFactory<T>`, the DbContext instance is disposed of automatically after each operation.
  - This prevents long-lived DbContext instances from accumulating in memory.

- **Avoids Thread Safety Issues**:
  - Since each database operation gets its own separate DbContext, there is no risk of concurrent access issues.

---
## Using `IDbContextFactory<T>` in a Blazor Server Application (Best Practice)

The goal is to avoid long-lived DbContext instances in Blazor Server by using `IDbContextFactory<T>`. This ensures that each database operation gets a fresh DbContext that is disposed of properly.

### Step 1: Configure `IDbContextFactory<T>` in Program.cs
Instead of registering DbContext as Scoped, register `IDbContextFactory<T>`:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddDbContextFactory<AppDbContext>(options =>
{
    options.UseSqlServer("");
});
```

### Step 2: Create a Service That Uses `IDbContextFactory<T>`
Instead of injecting DbContext directly, use `IDbContextFactory<AppDbContext>` to create a fresh DbContext instance for each database operation.

```csharp
public class AppUserService
{
    private readonly IDbContextFactory<AppDbContext> _dbContextFactory;

    public AppUserService(IDbContextFactory<AppDbContext> dbContextFactory)
    {
        _dbContextFactory = dbContextFactory;
    }

    public async Task<List<string>> GetUsersAsync()
    {
        using var context = await _dbContextFactory.CreateDbContextAsync();
        //return await context.Users.ToListAsync();

        return new List<string> { "Admin" };
    }
}
```

- `using var context = ...` → Ensures DbContext is automatically disposed after the operation.
- Each method gets a fresh DbContext instance, eliminating long-lived instances.

---
## Why Creating a New DbContext Per Operation Is the Best Practice?

1. **DbContext Is Not Thread-Safe**:
   - Blazor Server components are stateful and can handle multiple UI events asynchronously.
   - If a component holds a long-lived DbContext, multiple UI events (clicks, form submissions) can trigger concurrent operations on the same instance, leading to race conditions and threading issues.
   - By creating a fresh DbContext for each operation, we ensure thread safety.

2. **Prevents Memory Leaks**:
   - If a component holds a DbContext for too long, all tracked entities remain in memory.
   - Over time, this increases memory usage and can lead to performance degradation.
   - Creating a fresh DbContext for each operation ensures only the necessary data is loaded into memory and disposed of immediately.

3. **Mimics Traditional Request-Scoped Behavior**:
   - In traditional ASP.NET Core Web APIs, a new DbContext is created per HTTP request.
   - Since Blazor Server components persist beyond a single request, we need to manually control the lifecycle to match API behavior.
   - Using `IDbContextFactory<T>` ensures each method behaves like a separate HTTP request.

## DbContext Lifecycle: Should it be Scoped, Transient, or Singleton in Blazor?

In Blazor Server, choosing the correct lifetime for DbContext is crucial because Blazor components are long-lived, unlike traditional web applications where an HTTP request is short-lived and immediately disposed of after processing.

### Understanding DbContext Lifecycle Choices

Each lifetime affects how DbContext behaves in terms of resource management, performance, and data consistency. Let’s break down the three lifetimes and how they impact Blazor Server applications.

1. **Transient DbContext (Created Every Time)**:
- **Definition**: A new DbContext instance is created every time it is requested.
- **Code**:
```csharp
	builder.Services.AddTransient<ApplicationDbContext>();
```
- **Pros**:
 - Always fresh instance → Each call to the database gets a new, clean instance.
 - No concurrency issues → Since every operation gets its own instance, there are no risks of thread conflicts.
- **Cons**:
- Not suitable for Blazor Server → Because a component might call the database multiple times (e.g., on initialization and user interactions), each operation will have a completely new DbContext, losing change tracking between them.

2. **Scoped DbContext (Per SignalR Connection)**:
- **Definition**: A new DbContext instance is created once per user session (SignalR connection) and is shared across the component hierarchy during that session.
- **Code**:
```csharp
     builder.Services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
         options.UseSqlServer(connectionString));
 ```
- **Pros**:
- Best for Blazor Server → A single DbContext instance is created per SignalR connection, ensuring that all operations within the user's session share the same tracking context.
- Resource-friendly → Unlike Transient, this does not create a new DbContext for every operation but still ensures each user has their own instance.
- **Cons**:
- Concurrency issues possible → If a user triggers multiple operations simultaneously (e.g., clicking "Save" multiple times rapidly), EF Core might encounter tracking conflicts.

3. **Singleton DbContext (One for All Users)**:
- **Definition**: A single DbContext instance is created for the entire application and is shared across all users.
- **Code**:
```csharp
 builder.Services.AddSingleton<ApplicationDbContext>();
```
- **Pros**:
 - None in Blazor Server context.
- **Cons**:
- Dangerous in Blazor Server → Since all users share the same instance, their operations can interfere with each other.
- Concurrency issues → DbContext is not thread-safe, so multiple users modifying data at the same time may cause unexpected behavior and data corruption.
- Cached state issues → Changes made by one user may unexpectedly affect another user's session.

### Comparison of DbContext Lifetimes in Blazor Server

| Lifetime  | Instance per                          | Performance   | Thread Safety               | Suitable for Blazor Server? |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Transient | Every request                         | High overhead | Safe                        | No                          |
| Scoped    | Per user session (SignalR connection) | Optimized     | Possible concurrency issues | Yes                         |
| Singleton | Entire app                            | Memory risk   | Unsafe                      | Never                       |

## Setting Up EF Core in a Blazor Server Project
### Installing EF Core in a Blazor Server Project

When using EF Core in a Blazor Server application, you need to install the necessary NuGet packages to enable database interaction, design-time tools, and command-line interface (CLI) functionality. Let’s break down what each package does and why it is needed.

1. **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer**:
   - This package provides Entity Framework Core support for SQL Server. It contains the necessary libraries and functionality for interacting with a Microsoft SQL Server database.
   
   - **Why is it needed?**:
     - EF Core is database-agnostic, meaning it supports multiple database providers (SQL Server, SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.).
     - This package specifically enables SQL Server support, allowing you to connect to a SQL Server database and execute SQL queries using EF Core.
     - It provides SQL Server-specific optimizations such as better performance for bulk operations and native SQL Server features like JSON querying and temporal tables.
   - **How it works**:
     - When you register `UseSqlServer()` in `DbContextOptions`, it activates SQL Server as the database provider.
     - Internally, it translates LINQ queries into T-SQL (Transact-SQL), which is the query language of SQL Server.
     - It includes SQL Server-specific extensions for schema management, transactions, and performance tuning.
   - **Code**:
```csharp
builder.Services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>        options.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));
```

2. **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design**:
   - This package provides design-time tools for EF Core. It is mainly used for:
     - Creating and managing migrations
     - Scaffolding (reverse engineering) an existing database
     - Generating code based on your EF Core models
   - **Why is it needed?**:
     - EF Core allows you to create database migrations to apply schema changes incrementally.
     - The `dotnet ef` CLI commands rely on this package to generate and apply migrations.
     - Without this package, commands like `dotnet ef migrations add` will not work.
   - **Example Usage**:
```c#
 dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
 dotnet ef database update
```

3. **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools**:
   - This package enables Entity Framework Core commands in the .NET CLI (`dotnet ef`).
   - **Why is it needed?**:
     - It provides commands for managing the EF Core database schema, such as:
       - `dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationName>` (creates a new migration)
       - `dotnet ef database update` (applies migrations to the database)
       - `dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold` (reverse-engineers an existing database into EF Core models)
   - **Example usage**:
```c#
 dotnet ef migrations list
 dotnet ef migrations remove
 dotnet ef dbcontext info
```

4. **Difference Between Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design and Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools in CLI Usage**:
   - **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design**:
     - This package provides the API needed for EF Core design-time operations like:
       - Generating migrations
       - Updating the database
       - Scaffolding an existing database
     - It allows commands like:
```c#
   dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
   dotnet ef database update
```
   - **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools**:
     - This package enables the CLI tools for additional EF Core commands such as:
       - Listing existing migrations (`dotnet ef migrations list`)
       - Removing migrations (`dotnet ef migrations remove`)
       - Showing DbContext information (`dotnet ef dbcontext info`)
