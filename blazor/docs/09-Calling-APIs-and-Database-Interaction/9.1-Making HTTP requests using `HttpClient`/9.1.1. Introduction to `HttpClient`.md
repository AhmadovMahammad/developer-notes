HttpClient` is a powerful and flexible class provided by .NET to perform HTTP requests and handle responses. It is commonly used to interact with RESTful APIs and handle more complex HTTP tasks.

## Key Advantages of `HttpClient` Over `WebClient`

1. **Concurrency**:
   A single instance of `HttpClient` can handle multiple concurrent requests, enabling efficient resource usage and reducing overhead. In contrast, `WebClient` requires a new instance for each concurrent request.

2. **Custom Message Handlers**:
   `HttpClient` allows developers to plug in custom message handlers. These handlers can intercept requests and responses to add custom logic, such as logging, compression, or encryption.

   Custom message handlers are also helpful in unit testing because they enable easy mocking of HTTP responses, making `HttpClient` more test-friendly than `WebClient`.

3. **Extensible Header and Content System**:
   `HttpClient` has a rich type system for handling headers and content, allowing you to work with complex header configurations and different content types easily.

---
## Using `HttpClient` for Basic Requests

The simplest way to use `HttpClient` is to create an instance and use one of its `Get*` methods (such as `GetStringAsync`, `GetByteArrayAsync`, or `GetStreamAsync`) to perform a request:

```csharp
string html = await new HttpClient().GetStringAsync("https://bra-invest.com/");
Console.WriteLine(html);
```

All `HttpClient` methods that perform network I/O are asynchronous, which means you should always use `await` or `.Result` (with caution) when calling them. To avoid DNS resolution overhead and keep sockets from being held open unnecessarily, you should reuse the same `HttpClient` instance across multiple requests.

---
## Making Concurrent Requests with `HttpClient`

`HttpClient` supports concurrent requests, which makes it very efficient for applications that need to perform multiple network calls at once. Here’s how you can fetch multiple web pages in parallel:

```csharp
var client = new HttpClient();

var task1 = client.GetStringAsync("http://www.linqpad.net");
var task2 = client.GetStringAsync("http://www.albahari.com");

string[] results = await Task.WhenAll(task1, task2);
Console.WriteLine(string.Join("-", results));
```

---
## Configuration Options in `HttpClient`

`HttpClient` comes with several configurable properties to fine-tune request behavior:

1. **Timeout**:
   The `Timeout` property sets the maximum time to wait for a request to complete. If the timeout is reached, an exception is thrown. By default, this timeout is set to 100 seconds, but you can modify it based on your needs.

   ```csharp
   HttpClient client = new HttpClient()
   {
       Timeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10)
   };
   ```

2. **BaseAddress**:
   The `BaseAddress` property sets a base URL for all requests made by that `HttpClient` instance. This is particularly helpful when making multiple requests to the same base domain.

   ```csharp
   HttpClient client = new HttpClient()
   {
       Timeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10),
       BaseAddress = new Uri("https://bra-invest.com/")
   };

   string response = await client.GetStringAsync("about"); // Requests https://bra-invest.com/about
   ```

---
## Advanced Configuration with `HttpClientHandler`

To manage more advanced configurations, such as cookies, proxies, and authentication, `HttpClient` uses the `HttpClientHandler` class. You can create an instance of `HttpClientHandler` and pass it to the `HttpClient` constructor to control behavior at a lower level.

```csharp
HttpClientHandler handler = new HttpClientHandler()
{
    UseProxy = false,
    UseCookies = true
};

HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient(handler);
```

---
## Making a Request with `HttpClient`

To demonstrate, we'll use the free JSONPlaceholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) to fetch fake data like posts, comments, and users.

### Example: Basic GET Request

```csharp
HttpClientHandler handler = new HttpClientHandler() { UseCookies = true };
HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient(handler)
{
    BaseAddress = new Uri("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/"),
    Timeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5),
};

try
{
    // Send a GET request
    HttpResponseMessage httpResponseMessage = await httpClient.GetAsync("posts");
    httpResponseMessage.EnsureSuccessStatusCode(); // Ensure the response was successful

    string content = await httpResponseMessage.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
    Console.WriteLine($"Response Content: {content}");
}
catch (HttpRequestException exception)
{
    Console.WriteLine(exception.Message);
}
```

---
## Understanding Headers in `HttpClient`

HTTP headers provide additional information about the request or response. They are key-value pairs sent in the header section of HTTP messages.

### Common HTTP Headers

1. **User-Agent**:
   Identifies the client application making the request. Example: `Mozilla/5.0` for browsers or a custom string for APIs.

   ```csharp
   httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("User-Agent", "HttpClientExampleApp");
   ```

2. **Authorization**:
   Contains credentials to authenticate the client. Example: `Bearer <token>` for token-based authentication.

   ```csharp
   httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", "token");
   ```

3. **Content-Type**:
   Specifies the format of the request body. Example: `application/json` for JSON payloads.

4. **Accept**:
   Indicates the formats the client can process in the response. Example: `application/json` for JSON responses.

   ```csharp
   httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Add(new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue("application/json"));
   ```

---
### Example: Using Headers

```csharp
HttpClientHandler handler = new HttpClientHandler() { UseCookies = true };
HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient(handler)
{
    BaseAddress = new Uri("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/"),
    Timeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5),
};

httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("User-Agent", "HttpClientExampleApp");

try
{
    // Send a GET request
    HttpResponseMessage httpResponseMessage = await httpClient.GetAsync("posts/1");
    httpResponseMessage.EnsureSuccessStatusCode(); // Ensure the response was successful

    string content = await httpResponseMessage.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
    using JsonDocument jsonDocument = JsonDocument.Parse(content);
    JsonElement root = jsonDocument.RootElement;

    Console.WriteLine($"id: {root.GetProperty("id")}");
    Console.WriteLine($"title: {root.GetProperty("title")}");
    Console.WriteLine($"body: {root.GetProperty("body")}");
}
catch (HttpRequestException exception)
{
    Console.WriteLine(exception.Message);
}
```

---
## HTTP Status Codes and Exception Handling

When you send an HTTP request using `HttpClient`, the server responds with an HTTP status code. This status code indicates the outcome of the request:

- **2xx**: Success (e.g., 200 OK, 201 Created).
- **3xx**: Redirection (e.g., 301 Moved Permanently).
- **4xx**: Client Errors (e.g., 404 Not Found, 400 Bad Request).
- **5xx**: Server Errors (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error).

---
### Handling HTTP Status Codes in `HttpClient`

By default, `HttpClient` doesn’t throw exceptions for non-successful status codes (e.g., 404). However, network errors or DNS resolution failures will throw exceptions.

You can enforce status code validation by calling `httpResponseMessage.EnsureSuccessStatusCode()`. This method throws an exception if the status code is not in the 2xx range.

---
### Example: Handling Exceptions and Status Codes

```csharp
HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient()
{
    BaseAddress = new Uri("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/"),
    Timeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5),
};

try
{
    // Send a GET request to a valid endpoint
    HttpResponseMessage response = await httpClient.GetAsync("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1");

    // Check if the response is successful
    if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Request successful!");
        Console.WriteLine($"Status Code: {(int)response.StatusCode} {response.ReasonPhrase}");
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Request failed. Status Code: {(int)response.StatusCode} {response.ReasonPhrase}");
    }

    // Enforce successful response
    response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode(); // Throws an exception if not successful

    // Read and print the content
    string content = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
    Console.WriteLine("Response Content:");
    Console.WriteLine(content);
}
catch (HttpRequestException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Request error: {ex.Message}");
}
```

---
### Example: Saving Response Content to a File

The `HttpContent.CopyToAsync()` method lets you write response content directly to another stream. This is useful for downloading large files without loading them entirely into memory.

```csharp
response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode(); // Throws an exception if not successful

using FileStream fileStream = File.Create("response.json");
await response.Content.CopyToAsync(fileStream);
Console.WriteLine("Response content saved to 'response.json'");
```

---
## HTTP Verbs in `HttpClient`

`HttpClient` supports all four primary HTTP verbs through the following methods:

- **GetAsync**: Fetch data.
- **PostAsync**: Upload data to create a resource.
- **PutAsync**: Update a resource.
- **DeleteAsync**: Remove a resource.

These methods are asynchronous and return an `HttpResponseMessage`.

---
### Example: Using `PostAsync`

```csharp
HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient()
{
    BaseAddress = new Uri("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/"),
    Timeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5),
};

PostModel postModel = new PostModel()
{
    Id = 123456789,
    Title = "foo",
    Body = "bar",
};

string json = JsonSerializer.Serialize(postModel);
HttpContent httpContent = new ByteArrayContent(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(json));

try
{
    // Send a POST request
    HttpResponseMessage response = await httpClient.PostAsync("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts", httpContent);
    response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();

    string responseBody = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
    Console.WriteLine("Response:");
    Console.WriteLine(responseBody);
}
catch (HttpRequestException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Request error: {ex.Message}");
}
```

---
### Using `HttpRequestMessage` for Custom Requests

The four methods just described are all shortcuts for calling `SendAsync`, the single low-level method into which everything else feeds. To use this, you first construct an `HttpRequestMessage`:

```csharp
HttpRequestMessage httpRequestMessage = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, "posts/1");
```

This is equivalent to:

```csharp
httpClient.GetAsync("posts/1");
```

You can customize properties of the request, such as the headers and the content itself, allowing you to upload data.

---
### Example: Customizing a Request with `HttpRequestMessage`

```csharp
string json = JsonSerializer.Serialize(postModel);
HttpContent httpContent = new ByteArrayContent(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(json));

HttpRequestMessage httpRequestMessage = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Post, "posts")
{
    Content = httpContent
};
httpRequestMessage.Headers.Accept.Add(new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue("application/json"));
httpRequestMessage.Headers.Add("Custom-Header", "HttpClientExample");

try
{
    // Send a POST request
    HttpResponseMessage response = await httpClient.SendAsync(httpRequestMessage);
    response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();

    string responseBody = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
    Console.WriteLine("Response:");
    Console.WriteLine(responseBody);
}
catch (HttpRequestException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Request error: {ex.Message}");
}
```
