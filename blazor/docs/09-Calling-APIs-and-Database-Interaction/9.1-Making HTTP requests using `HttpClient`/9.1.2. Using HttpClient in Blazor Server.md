Blazor Server applications run on the server, not the client’s browser. This means that HttpClient in Blazor Server works differently from Blazor WebAssembly. Since Blazor Server has full access to the .NET runtime, it does not rely on the browser's fetch API like Blazor WebAssembly does. Instead, HttpClient in Blazor Server functions just like in any other .NET application but is managed differently due to Blazor’s component model.

## The main reason HttpClient works differently in Blazor WebAssembly (WASM) and Blazor Server is where the code runs and how network requests are handled.

### Difference #1
In Blazor Server, the code runs on the server, which has full access to .NET's networking stack. When you make an HTTP request, Blazor Server directly uses .NET’s built-in HttpClientHandler to send the request over the network, just like any regular ASP.NET Core application. Since the request originates from the server, it does not have to follow browser security rules like CORS, making it more flexible.

### Difference #2
In contrast, Blazor WebAssembly runs inside the browser. The browser does not allow direct network access for security reasons, so Blazor WASM’s HttpClient cannot use .NET’s networking stack. Instead, it relies on the browser’s built-in fetch API to make requests. This means that all network calls are subject to browser security restrictions, including CORS policies, meaning it can only call APIs that explicitly allow cross-origin requests. In short, Blazor Server makes network requests like a normal .NET application, while Blazor WASM is restricted by the browser’s networking rules because it does not have direct control over network connections.

## 9.1.2.1. Why Do We Need HttpClient in Blazor Server?

In a Blazor Server application, HttpClient plays a crucial role in making network requests to external or internal APIs. Unlike traditional web applications where a browser directly makes API requests, Blazor Server operates differently. It runs entirely on the server and maintains a real-time SignalR connection with the client. This means the browser does not directly communicate with external APIs; instead, all API requests must be made from the server, which is where HttpClient becomes essential.

Since Blazor Server is not a front-end framework like React or Angular, it does not rely on the browser to fetch data. Instead, it executes code on the server-side, meaning all API calls must also happen from the server. This brings several advantages:

1. **Direct Network Access**: Unlike Blazor WebAssembly, which is restricted by the browser’s security policies (CORS, same-origin policies, etc.), Blazor Server has full access to the .NET runtime. This means it can make HTTP requests without being blocked by browser security limitations.

2. **Efficient Data Handling**: Blazor Server applications can fetch data from APIs, process it, and send only the necessary parts to the client through SignalR. This reduces the amount of data sent to the browser, improving performance.

3. **Authentication and Authorization**: Some APIs require authentication (e.g., OAuth, JWT tokens). Since the server has full control, it can securely store authentication tokens and attach them to API requests using HttpClient.

*How is HttpClient Used in Blazor Server?
*Injecting HttpClient in a Blazor Component
#### Step #1: Registering HttpClient in the DI Container

To make HttpClient available throughout your Blazor Server app, you first need to register it in the DI container in the Program.cs file. This process enables the DI system to know about the existence of HttpClient and provides a mechanism to manage its lifecycle.

Here’s the code to register HttpClient:

```csharp
// Register HttpClient with DI container
builder.Services.AddHttpClient();
```

#### Why Is It Registered as Scoped?

In Blazor Server, HttpClient is registered as a scoped service. This means:

1. **Scoped Lifespan**: HttpClient will be created once per user session, which means all components in the same user session will share the same instance of HttpClient. This is crucial for performance and ensures that the client does not repeatedly create and dispose of HttpClient instances.

2. **Thread-Safe**: HttpClient is inherently thread-safe, which means multiple components or services can use the same instance concurrently without issues. It allows asynchronous HTTP calls from different parts of the application simultaneously without the need for separate instances of HttpClient.

#### Step #2: Injecting HttpClient into a Blazor Component

Once registered, you can inject HttpClient into your Blazor components. The DI system will automatically inject the registered instance of HttpClient into your component at runtime. This allows the component to make HTTP requests, such as fetching data from an external API.

Here is an example of how to inject HttpClient and use it in a Blazor component:

```c#
@page "/users"
@inject HttpClient Http

<h3>Users</h3>

<div class="users-container">
    @if (_users != null)
    {
        @foreach (var user in _users)
        {
            <div class="user-card">
                <h4>@user.Name</h4>
                <p><strong>Username:</strong> @user.Username</p>
                <p><strong>Email:</strong> @user.Email</p>
                <p><strong>Phone:</strong> @user.Phone</p>
                <p><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://@user.Website" target="_blank">@user.Website</a></p>
                <p><strong>Company:</strong> @user.Company.Name</p>
                <p><strong>Address:</strong> @user.Address.Street, @user.Address.City (@user.Address.Zipcode)</p>
            </div>
        }
    }
</div>

@code {
    private List<User> _users = new();

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        _users = await Http.GetFromJsonAsync<List<User>>("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users") ?? new();
    }

    private class User
    {
        public string Name { get; set; } = string.Empty;
        public string Username { get; set; } = string.Empty;
        public string Email { get; set; } = string.Empty;
        public string Phone { get; set; } = string.Empty;
        public string Website { get; set; } = string.Empty;
        public Address Address { get; set; } = new();
        public Company Company { get; set; } = new();
    }

    private class Address
    {
        public string Street { get; set; } = string.Empty;
        public string City { get; set; } = string.Empty;
        public string Zipcode { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    }

    private class Company
    {
        public string Name { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    }
}

<style>
    .users-container {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
        gap: 16px;
        padding: 20px;
    }

    .user-card {
        background: #f9f9f9;
        border-radius: 10px;
        padding: 15px;
        box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
        transition: transform 0.2s;
    }

    .user-card:hover {
        transform: scale(1.05);
    }

    .user-card h4 {
        margin-bottom: 10px;
    }

    .user-card p {
        margin: 5px 0;
    }
</style>
```

## 9.1.2.4. Using Named HttpClient Instances in Blazor Server

In a Blazor Server application, when working with external APIs, it is common to interact with multiple APIs that have different base URLs, authentication mechanisms, or headers. If all API requests were made using a single HttpClient instance, it would require constant reconfiguration, which can be inefficient and error-prone. Named HttpClient instances provide a way to define multiple pre-configured HttpClient objects, each suited for a specific API, thus improving maintainability and performance.

### Why Use Named HttpClient Instances?

By default, when you register HttpClient in Program.cs using `builder.Services.AddHttpClient();`, you get a generic HttpClient instance that can be injected into components. However, this approach has limitations when dealing with multiple APIs:

1. **Different Base Addresses**: Suppose one API is `https://api.github.com/`, while another is `https://localhost:5001/api/`. If you use a single HttpClient, you need to manually set the BaseAddress before every request, increasing complexity and the risk of incorrect configurations.

2. **Different Headers and Authentication**: Some APIs require authentication headers (e.g., GitHub API requires a User-Agent header). If multiple APIs require different headers, manually modifying the HttpClient before each request can lead to errors.

3. **Improved Maintainability and Reusability**: Instead of configuring HttpClient inside each component, named clients allow defining configurations globally in Program.cs, making the code cleaner and easier to maintain.

4. **Avoids Unnecessary Object Creation**: Creating and disposing of HttpClient objects manually is inefficient and can lead to socket exhaustion. IHttpClientFactory manages the lifecycle of HttpClient instances efficiently.

### How to Register Named HttpClient Instances in Blazor Server?

Named HttpClient instances are configured inside Program.cs when setting up dependency injection. Each named instance has its own configuration, such as BaseAddress and default headers.

```csharp
builder.Services.AddHttpClient("OpenWeather", httpClient =>
{
    httpClient.BaseAddress = new Uri("https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/");
    httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("Accept", "application/json");
});

builder.Services.AddHttpClient("JsonPlaceholder", httpClient =>
{
    httpClient.BaseAddress = new Uri("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/");
    httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("Accept", "application/json");
});
```

Each named client now has a unique configuration, making it easier to manage multiple APIs efficiently.

### Using Named HttpClient Instances in a Blazor Component

Once named HttpClient instances are registered, they can be accessed inside Blazor components using IHttpClientFactory. Unlike injecting HttpClient directly, we now inject IHttpClientFactory, which allows us to create HttpClient instances dynamically.

#### Example: Fetching Data from Multiple APIs in a Blazor Component

```c#
@page "/login"
@inject IHttpClientFactory ClientFactory

<h3>JSONPlaceholder Users</h3>
@if (users != null)
{
    <ul>
        @foreach (var user in users)
        {
            <li>@user.Name</li>
        }
    </ul>
}
else
{
    <p>Loading users...</p>
}

<h3>Weather in London</h3>
@if (weatherData != null)
{
    <p>Temperature: @weatherData.Main.Temp °C</p>
}
else
{
    <p>Loading weather data...</p>
}

@code {
    private List<User>? users = new List<User>();
    private WeatherResponse? weatherData = new WeatherResponse();

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        var jsonPlaceholderClient = ClientFactory.CreateClient("JsonPlaceholder");
        users = await jsonPlaceholderClient.GetFromJsonAsync<List<User>>("users");

        var weatherClient = ClientFactory.CreateClient("OpenWeather");
        weatherData = await weatherClient.GetFromJsonAsync<WeatherResponse>("weather?q=London&appid=YOUR_API_KEY&units=metric");
    }

    public class User
    {
        public string Name { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    }

    public class WeatherResponse
    {
        public MainData Main { get; set; } = new MainData();
    }

    public class MainData
    {
        public float Temp { get; set; }
    }
}
```

#### Weather Example

```c#
@page "/login"
@inject IHttpClientFactory ClientFactory

<p>Enter city name</p>
<input @bind-value="City" />

@if (weatherData != null)
{
    <p>Temperature: @weatherData.Main.Temp °C</p>
}
else if (isLoading)
{
    <p>Loading weather data...</p>
}

@code {
    private WeatherResponse? weatherData;
    private string city = string.Empty;
    private bool isLoading = false;
    private CancellationTokenSource? cts;
    private readonly string apiKey = "apiKey";

    public string City
    {
        get => city;
        set
        {
            city = value;
            _ = OnCityChanged();
        }
    }

    private async Task OnCityChanged()
    {
        cts?.Cancel();
        cts = new CancellationTokenSource();
        var token = cts.Token;

        if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(city))
        {
            await LoadDataForCity(token);
        }
    }

    private async Task LoadDataForCity(CancellationToken token)
    {
        try
        {
            isLoading = true;
            weatherData = null;

            string URL = $"weather?q={city}&units=metric&appid={apiKey}";
            var weatherClient = ClientFactory.CreateClient("OpenWeather");
            var response = await weatherClient.GetAsync(URL, token);

            if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
            {
                weatherData = await response.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync<WeatherResponse>(token);
            }
        }
        catch (TaskCanceledException)
        {
            // Request was canceled due to fast typing, ignore it
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Error fetching weather data: {ex.Message}");
        }
        finally
        {
            isLoading = false;
            StateHasChanged();
        }
    }

    public class WeatherResponse
    {
        public MainData Main { get; set; } = new MainData();
    }

    public class MainData
    {
        public float Temp { get; set; }
    }
}
```

### Using apiKey in appSettings.json file:

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "OpenWeather": {
    "ApiKey": "apiKey"
  }
}
```

### Using apiKey from Configuration

```c#
@inject IConfiguration Configuration
string apiKey = Configuration["OpenWeather:ApiKey"] ?? string.Empty;
```
