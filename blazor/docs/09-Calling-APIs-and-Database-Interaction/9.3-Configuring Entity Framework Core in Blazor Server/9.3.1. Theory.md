}
```

### Before we configure primary keys, composite keys, navigation properties, and relationships using Fluent API, we need a deep theoretical understanding of each concept.


#### 1. Primary Keys and Composite Keys in EF Core
Every table in a relational database must have a **primary key (PK)**, which uniquely identifies each record in that table. EF Core allows defining primary keys in two ways:

1. **Single-column primary keys** (most common).
2. **Composite primary keys** (using multiple columns).

###### 1.1. Primary Keys in EF Core
A **primary key (PK)** is a column that guarantees each record in a table is unique and can be referenced reliably.

**1.1.1 Default Behavior of Primary Keys**
By default, EF Core assumes that:

- A property named `Id` or `{EntityName}Id` will be the **primary key**.
- The primary key will automatically be mapped to the database as a `unique`, `non-nullable` column.
- If a primary key is an integer, EF Core enables **auto-increment (Identity column)** by default.

**1.1.2 Defining a Primary Key Using Fluent API**
In cases where the property name does **not** follow EF Core’s convention (`Id` or `{EntityName}Id`), we must define it explicitly in the `OnModelCreating` method.

Example: Explicit Primary Key Configuration

``` c#
public class User
{
    public int UserKey { get; set; } // Not following EF Core's default convention
    public string Name { get; set; } = string.Empty;
}
```

Since `UserKey` does not match `Id` or `UserId`, we **must** explicitly define it as a primary key in Fluent API:

``` c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>()
        .HasKey(u => u.UserKey); // Explicitly setting primary key
}
```

###### 1.2. Composite Keys in EF Core
A **composite key** consists of multiple columns, meaning **more than one column together** uniquely identifies a row.

**1.2.1 Why Use Composite Keys?**
- Some tables **don’t have a single unique identifier**, and uniqueness is defined by a combination of columns.
- Example: In a **many-to-many** relationship, the junction table uses **two foreign keys** as a composite primary key.
- EF Core **does not support composite keys with data annotations**, so Fluent API is required.

**1.2.2. Defining a Composite Key Using Fluent API**
Let’s say we have a **UserRole** table to manage a many-to-many relationship between `Users` and `Roles`:

``` c#
public class UserRole
{
    public int UserId { get; set; } // FK to User
    public int RoleId { get; set; } // FK to Role

    public User User { get; set; } = null!;
    public Role Role { get; set; } = null!;
}
```

Since `UserRole` does not have a single primary key column, we **must** define a composite key in `OnModelCreating`:

``` c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<UserRole>()
        .HasKey(ur => new { ur.UserId, ur.RoleId }); // Composite Primary Key
}
```

#### 2. Navigation Properties in EF Core
Unlike scalar properties (e.g., `int`, `string`), navigation properties reference other entities, allowing you to access related data **without manually writing JOIN queries**.
Navigation properties are the **bridge** between related tables in an object-oriented way.

###### 2.1. How Navigation Properties Work in EF Core?
Navigation properties **connect related tables** in EF Core, allowing us to work with objects instead of writing manual SQL `JOIN` queries. EF Core **automatically detects relationships** if the foreign key is properly defined. However, we can control **how and when** related data is loaded using three different techniques:


**2.1.1. Lazy Loading (Optional) – Load Data When Needed**
With **lazy loading**, related data is **not loaded immediately**. Instead, it is fetched **only when accessed**.

``` c#
var user = context.Users.Find(1); 
Console.WriteLine(user.Profile.Bio); // Triggers a query to load UserProfile
```

The **UserProfile** is **not loaded** when the `User` is retrieved.  
It is **only loaded** when `user.Profile.Bio` is accessed.

✅ **Advantage:** Reduces initial query load.  
❌ **Disadvantage:** Can cause **multiple small queries** (N+1 problem).

To use **Lazy Loading** in EF Core, you need to follow a few steps to ensure it works properly, as it requires enabling **proxies** to intercept property access and load related data when needed.

2.1.1.1. Install the Required NuGet Package
Lazy loading in EF Core requires the **EF Core Proxies** package, which provides the ability to create proxy objects for your entities. This allows EF Core to intercept navigation property accesses and load the related entities when needed.

You can install the NuGet package by running this command in your package manager:
``` c#
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Proxies
```

This package allows EF Core to generate proxy objects that intercept calls to navigation properties, triggering lazy loading.

2.1.1.2. Enable Proxies in `DbContext` Configuration
After installing the required package, you need to **configure EF Core to use proxies**. This is done by modifying your `DbContext` configuration.

In the `OnConfiguring` method (or `Program.cs` if you're using dependency injection), enable proxies like this:

```c#
builder.Services.AddDbContext<AppDbContext>(options =>
{
    options
        .UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection"))
        .UseLazyLoadingProxies(); // Enable Lazy Loading in DI
});
```

`.UseLazyLoadingProxies()` is the key method that enables the proxy generation, allowing **lazy loading** of navigation properties.

2.1.1.3. Define Navigation Properties as Virtual
In order for lazy loading to work, your navigation properties must be marked as `virtual`. This allows EF Core to create a proxy class that overrides the getter and setter methods.

``` c#
public class User
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }

    // Navigation property must be virtual
    public virtual UserProfile Profile { get; set; }
}
```

**Important:** If the navigation property is **not marked as `virtual`**, EF Core cannot create a proxy and lazy loading will not work.

---
A **proxy** in the context of **EF Core** (when using **lazy loading**) is a **special class** that wraps around your entity. This class is generated at runtime and inherits from your original entity class. The proxy is responsible for **intercepting** accesses to navigation properties and loading the related data when needed. It acts as a **"proxy"** between your application code and the actual entity data stored in the database.

- When you use the **`UseLazyLoadingProxies()`** feature, EF Core generates a proxy class for your entities that need lazy loading.
- This proxy class will **inherit** from your original entity class, and it will override the **getter and setter** of the navigation properties that are marked as `virtual`.
- The key to lazy loading is that the **navigation properties** (like `User.Profile`) are marked as **`virtual`**.
- When the navigation property is **accessed** for the first time, EF Core's proxy intercepts the access. It then **queries the database** to load the related data (such as `UserProfile` in this case) and assigns it to the navigation property.


**2.1.2. Eager Loading – Load Everything in One Query**
With **eager loading**, related data is retrieved **immediately** along with the main entity.

``` c#
var user = context.Users.Include(u => u.Profile).FirstOrDefault(u => u.Id == 1);
```

The **UserProfile** is loaded **together** with the `User`.  
EF Core generates a **single SQL query with a JOIN**.

✅ **Advantage:** Avoids multiple queries (better for performance in some cases). 
❌ **Disadvantage:** Can load **unnecessary** related data, making queries heavy.


**2.1.3. Explicit Loading – Load Data Manually**
With **explicit loading**, related data is loaded **only when explicitly requested**.

``` c#
var user = context.Users.Find(1);
context.Entry(user).Reference(u => u.Profile).Load();
```

The **UserProfile** is loaded **only when `Load()` is called**.

✅ **Advantage:** More control over when data is loaded.  
❌ **Disadvantage:** Requires **additional code** and manual handling.



###### 2.2. One-to-One Relationship Navigation Properties
In a **one-to-one relationship**, each entity is linked to **exactly one** instance of the other entity. This means that for each record in the first table, there is a corresponding record in the second table, and vice versa.

**Understanding Navigation Properties in a One-to-One Relationship:**

- **Navigation properties** allow you to navigate from one entity to the related entity in your code.
- In a **one-to-one relationship**, you’ll need to create navigation properties on **both sides** of the relationship.

``` c#
public class User
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; } = string.Empty;

    // Navigation property for one-to-one relationship with UserProfile
    public virtual UserProfile Profile { get; set; } = null!;
}

public class UserProfile
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Bio { get; set; } = string.Empty;

    // Foreign key and navigation property for one-to-one relationship with User
    public int UserId { get; set; }
    public virtual User User { get; set; } = null!;
}
```


**How Does It Work?**

1. **User ↔ UserProfile (One-to-One)**:
    
    - In the `User` class, there is a navigation property `Profile` that points to the related `UserProfile`.
    - In the `UserProfile` class, there is a navigation property `User` that refers back to the related `User`.
2. **Foreign Key**:
    
    - The `UserProfile` class contains a foreign key (`UserId`) pointing to the primary key of the `User` table. This creates a link between the two entities.
    - In a **one-to-one relationship**, the foreign key must be unique to maintain the one-to-one constraint. Each `UserProfile` can only be linked to **one** `User`.
3. **Virtual Properties**:
    
    - We use the `virtual` keyword for navigation properties. This allows EF Core to create a **proxy** for lazy loading if proxies are enabled.
    - By using `virtual`, EF Core can **automatically load** the related data when it’s accessed if you’re using **lazy loading**.


**Configuring One-to-One Relationships with Fluent API**
You can configure **one-to-one relationships** using Fluent API in EF Core in the **`OnModelCreating`** method. Here’s an example configuration:

``` c#
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);

    // One-to-one relationship between User and UserProfile
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>()
    .HasOne(u => u.Profile)  // User has one UserProfile
    .WithOne(up => up.User)   // UserProfile has one User
	.HasForeignKey<UserProfile>(up => up.UserId); // Foreign key in UserProfile
}
```

**Key Points**:

- `HasOne(u => u.Profile)`: Specifies that the `User` entity has one related `UserProfile`.
- `WithOne(p => p.User)`: Specifies that the `UserProfile` entity has one related `User`.
- `HasForeignKey<UserProfile>(p => p.UserId)`: Defines the foreign key in the `UserProfile` entity, which links it to the `User` entity.


**Why Not Use One-to-One Relationships Too Much?**

In practice, **one-to-one relationships** aren’t as common as one-to-many or many-to-many relationships. This is because many entities are naturally related to multiple other entities (e.g., a user may have many orders), and often, a one-to-one relationship can be modeled as a **one-to-many** relationship if needed.

---
The configuration we wrote 
``` c#
modelBuilder.Entity<User>()
    .HasOne(u => u.Profile)  // User has one UserProfile
    .WithOne(up => up.User)   // UserProfile has one User
    .HasForeignKey<UserProfile>(up => up.UserId); // Foreign key in UserProfile
```
is **already bidirectional** and fully defines the relationship between `User` and `UserProfile`.
This **already establishes the reverse relationship**, so we do **not** need to add another configuration for `UserProfile`.

If you tried to add another configuration like this:
``` c#
modelBuilder.Entity<UserProfile>()
    .HasOne(up => up.User)
    .WithOne(u => u.Profile)
    .HasForeignKey<User>(u => u.Id); // ❌ Wrong! User should not have a foreign key to UserProfile
```

It would **conflict** because EF Core already knows how to handle the relationship.
So, **first configuration is enough**. You do **not** need to define it again for `UserProfile`.


**Why Do We Add `UserId` as a Foreign Key in `UserProfile` Instead of `UserProfileId` in `User`?**
To understand this, let's break it down step by step.

**1. What Does a Foreign Key Actually Do?**
A **foreign key (FK)** is a column in one table that **references the primary key (PK) of another table**. It establishes a **relationship** between two tables.

For example,

- If **Table A** has a foreign key to **Table B**, that means each record in **Table A** is linked to a specific record in **Table B**.
- The foreign key **must be placed on the table that depends on the other table**.

**2. What Happens When We Query Data?**

**Scenario 1: Loading a `User` and Including the `UserProfile`**

``` c#
var user = context.Users
    .Include(u => u.Profile)
    .FirstOrDefault(u => u.Id == 1);
```

- EF Core looks at `User.Id`.
- It finds `UserProfile` where `UserProfile.UserId == User.Id`.
- It loads the `UserProfile` along with the `User`.

**Scenario 2: Loading a `UserProfile` and Including the `User`**

``` c#
var profile = context.UserProfiles
    .Include(up => up.User)
    .FirstOrDefault(up => up.Id == 1);
```

- EF Core looks at `UserProfile.UserId`.
- It finds the matching `User` where `User.Id == UserProfile.UserId`.
- It loads the `User`.

**3. General Rule for One-to-One Relationships**
In **one-to-one** relationships:

- **The dependent entity (the one that cannot exist without the other) should hold the foreign key.**
- Here, `UserProfile` **depends** on `User`, so it holds the `UserId` foreign key.

This follows **database normalization** principles and avoids unnecessary NULL values in the `User` table.

**4. What is `DbSet<T>`?**

- `DbSet<T>` represents a **collection of entities** in your database. It is a table in the database, where `T` is the type of entity you are working with (like `User`, `Product`, etc.).

**5. Why do we need `DbSet<T>`?**

1. **Mapping Entities to Tables**:
    
    - `DbSet<T>` is how EF Core knows which table in the database to map each class (entity) to.
    - For example, if you have a `User` class and a `UserProfile` class, the `DbSet<User>` will represent the `Users` table in the database and `DbSet<UserProfile>` will represent the `UserProfiles` table.
2. **Querying Data**:
    
    - `DbSet<T>` provides methods like `Add()`, `Remove()`, and `Find()` that you can use to interact with the table. It's your main interface for **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for that table.
3. **Tracking Changes**:
    
    - EF Core uses `DbSet<T>` to track changes to the entities, so when you update a `User`, it knows which record to update in the database.
    - When you query `DbSet<User>`, EF Core keeps track of what’s in memory and can automatically detect if the object was modified, deleted, or added.
4. **Performing Queries**:
    
    - You can use `DbSet<T>` to query the database. For example:

``` c#
var users = context.Users.Where(u => u.Name.Contains("Mahammad")).ToList();
```

###### **2.3. One-to-Many Relationship in EF Core**
A **one-to-many relationship** means that **one record in a table** is related to **multiple records in another table**.

**Example: Users and Orders (One-to-Many)**

- **One `User` can have multiple `Orders`** (A user can place multiple orders).
- **Each `Order` belongs to exactly one `User`**.



**Step 1: Define the Entities**

``` c#
public class User
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; } = string.Empty;

    public virtual UserProfile? Profile { get; set; }
    public virtual ICollection<Order> Orders { get; set; } = new List<Order>();
}

public class Order
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    public decimal Price { get; set; }

    public int UserId { get; set; }
    public virtual User User { get; set; } = null!;
}
```

- `ICollection<Order>` → **Defines a collection of orders for a user** (One-to-Many).
- `virtual` is used for Lazy Loading support.
- `UserId` → **Foreign Key (FK) that links an order to a user**.
- `User` → **Navigation property to access the related user**.



**Step 2: Configure the Relationship in `OnModelCreating`**

``` c#
public class AppDbContext(DbContextOptions dbContextOptions) : DbContext(dbContextOptions)
{
    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);

        // Primary Key configuration
        modelBuilder.Entity<User>()
	        .HasKey(u => u.Id);  // Primary key for User entity
        modelBuilder.Entity<UserProfile>()
	        .HasKey(up => up.Id);  // Primary key for UserProfile entity
        modelBuilder.Entity<Order>()
	        .HasKey(o => o.Id);  // Primary key for Order Entity

        // Relationship configuration
        modelBuilder.Entity<User>()
            .HasOne(u => u.Profile)  // User has one UserProfile
            .WithOne(up => up.User)   // UserProfile has one User
            .HasForeignKey<UserProfile>(up => up.UserId); // Foreign key in UserProfile

        modelBuilder.Entity<User>()
            .HasMany(u => u.Orders)  // User has many Orders
            .WithOne(o => o.User)    // Each Order belongs to one User
            .HasForeignKey(o => o.UserId); // Foreign key in Order table
    }

    public DbSet<User> Users { get; set; }
    public DbSet<UserProfile> UserProfiles { get; set; }
    public DbSet<Order> Orders { get; set; }
}
```

**Why is `HasForeignKey<UserProfile>(up => up.UserId)` needed in One-to-One but not in One-to-Many? **
The difference arises due to how EF Core handles **one-to-one** vs **one-to-many** relationships internally.


**Why do we need `<UserProfile>` in `HasForeignKey`?**

- In **one-to-one relationships**, EF Core needs to know **which entity holds the foreign key**.
- By default, it cannot infer this automatically because **both tables could theoretically store the foreign key**.
- The `HasForeignKey<UserProfile>(up => up.UserId)` explicitly tells EF Core:  
    **"The foreign key (`UserId`) is in the `UserProfile` table."**
- Without this, EF Core might assume the foreign key is in `User` instead, leading to unintended behavior.


**Why do we NOT need `<Order>` in `HasForeignKey`?**

- In **one-to-many relationships**, EF Core knows **by default** that the foreign key **must be in the "many" side** (i.e., `Orders` table).
- There’s no ambiguity: each `Order` **must have** a `UserId` column, since every `Order` belongs to a `User`.
- So, specifying `HasForeignKey(o => o.UserId)` is enough—EF Core already knows it applies to `Order`.


###### **2.4. Many-to-Many Relationships in EF Core**
In **relational databases**, a **many-to-many** relationship means that multiple records in one table are related to multiple records in another table. This is managed using a **junction table** (also called a bridge or linking table), which stores the relationships between the two tables.

EF Core **automatically creates a junction table** when defining a many-to-many relationship **without an explicit entity**. But in some cases, we need a custom junction table (also called an entity) to store extra information.

---
**2.4.1. How Many-to-Many Works in EF Core?**
Let's consider a **Users and Roles** example:

- A **User** can have multiple **Roles** (e.g., Admin, Editor, User).
- A **Role** can be assigned to multiple **Users**.
- This forms a **many-to-many** relationship.

**Two Ways to Configure Many-to-Many in EF Core**

1. **Implicit Many-to-Many (Without Junction Entity)** – EF Core automatically creates the junction table.
2. **Explicit Many-to-Many (With a Junction Entity)** – We manually define a junction entity.

---
**2.4.1.1. Implicit Many-to-Many (Without a Junction Table)**
When we define a **many-to-many relationship without a junction entity**, EF Core **automatically** creates a table for us.

**Example: Users and Roles (Without Explicit Junction Table)**

```csharp
public class User
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; } = string.Empty;

    public virtual UserProfile? Profile { get; set; }
    public virtual ICollection<Order> Orders { get; set; } = new List<Order>();
    public virtual ICollection<Role> Roles { get; set; } = new List<Role>();
}

public class Role
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; } = string.Empty;

    public virtual ICollection<User> Users { get; set; } = new List<User>();
}

```

**Fluent API Configuration**

```csharp
modelBuilder.Entity<User>()
    .HasMany(u => u.Roles)
    .WithMany(r => r.Users)
    .UsingEntity(junction => junction.ToTable("UserRoles")); 
    // EF Core will create "UserRoles" table automatically
```

**What Happens Here?**

- EF Core **automatically creates** a table named **UserRoles**.
- The table has two **foreign keys**: `UserId` and `RoleId`.
- **No need for an explicit entity** for the junction table.
- The **navigation properties** (`ICollection<Role>` and `ICollection<User>`) help EF Core understand the relationship.

---
**2.4.1.2. Explicit Many-to-Many (With a Junction Table)**
Sometimes, we need **a separate entity** (junction table) if we want to **store extra data** about the relationship.

**Example: Users and Roles (With Junction Table)**

```csharp
public class User
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; } = string.Empty;

    public virtual UserProfile? Profile { get; set; }
    public virtual ICollection<Order> Orders { get; set; } = new List<Order>();
    public virtual ICollection<UserRole> UserRoles { get; set; } = new List<UserRole>();
}

public class Role
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; } = string.Empty;

    public virtual ICollection<UserRole> UserRoles { get; set; } = new List<UserRole>();
}

public class UserRole  // Junction Table
{
    public int UserId { get; set; }
    public User User { get; set; } = null!;

    public int RoleId { get; set; }
    public Role Role { get; set; } = null!;

    public DateTime AssignedDate { get; set; }
}
```

**Fluent API Configuration**

```csharp
 modelBuilder.Entity<UserRole>().HasKey(ur => new { ur.UserId, ur.RoleId });  
 // Composite Primary Key

modelBuilder.Entity<UserRole>()
    .HasOne(ur => ur.User)
    .WithMany(u => u.UserRoles)
    .HasForeignKey(ur => ur.UserId);

modelBuilder.Entity<UserRole>()
    .HasOne(ur => ur.Role)
    .WithMany(r => r.UserRoles)
    .HasForeignKey(ur => ur.RoleId);
```

**What Happens Here?**

- **UserRole** is a **junction table** with a **composite primary key** (`UserId, RoleId`).
- We store **extra data** (`AssignedDate`) in the junction table.
- We manually **define the foreign keys** using **Fluent API**.



###### **2.5. Fluent API for Property Configuration in EF Core**
In Entity Framework Core (EF Core), **property configuration** determines how entity properties are mapped to database columns. You can configure properties using either **Data Annotations** (attributes on properties) or the **Fluent API** (inside `OnModelCreating`).

While Data Annotations provide a quick way to define constraints, the Fluent API offers **greater flexibility** and **more advanced configurations** that cannot be achieved with attributes alone.


**Why Use Fluent API for Property Configuration?**

1. **More Control & Flexibility**
    
    - Fluent API allows you to define **column types, constraints, default values, computed columns, and more**.
    - Example: You can configure decimal precision (`HasPrecision(18, 4)`) or specify column types (`HasColumnType("varchar(255)")`).
2. **Better Separation of Concerns**
    
    - Instead of cluttering entity classes with annotations, Fluent API centralizes all configuration in `OnModelCreating`.
    - This makes your **entity classes cleaner** and easier to maintain.
3. **Supports Complex Configurations**
    
    - Fluent API is required for **composite keys**, **custom indexes**, **table splitting**, and **alternate keys**.
    - Example: Composite keys (`HasKey(e => new { e.OrderId, e.ProductId })`) cannot be set with attributes.


---
**1. Configuring Column Types**
You can explicitly define the column type in the database:

``` c#
modelBuilder.Entity<Order>()
    .Property(o => o.Name)
    .HasColumnType("varchar(255)");
```

**2. Setting Maximum Length**
To avoid unnecessary storage space:

``` c#
modelBuilder.Entity<Order>()
    .Property(o => o.Name)
    .HasMaxLength(100);
```

**3. Making Properties Required (Non-Nullable)**
Instead of `[Required]`:

``` c#
modelBuilder.Entity<UserProfile>()
    .Property(u => u.Bio)
    .IsRequired();
```

**4. Setting Default Values**
If no value is provided, the default will be used:

``` c#
modelBuilder.Entity<UserRole>()
    .Property(ur => ur.AssignedDate)
    .HasDefaultValueSql("GETDATE()");
```

**5. Indexing for Faster Queries**
To speed up queries on frequently searched columns:

``` c#
modelBuilder.Entity<User>()
    .HasIndex(u => u.Email)
    .IsUnique();
```


### **TODO: N + 1 Problem**
