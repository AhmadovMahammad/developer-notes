Form validation is a crucial part of any web application, ensuring that users enter valid data before submission. In Blazor, `DataAnnotations` provide a declarative, model-driven approach to form validation.

Blazor integrates with the .NET validation system, allowing you to use attributes like `[Required]`, `[StringLength]`, `[Range]`, `[EmailAddress]`, and even custom validation logic.

This deep dive will cover:
- How validation works internally in Blazor.
- Why `DataAnnotations` are used and their advantages.
- Built-in validation attributes and how they function.

## 1. How Validation Works Internally in Blazor

Let's dive deep into the internal mechanics of form validation in Blazor to understand how it works under the hood. Blazor's validation system is built around several key components that work together to provide a cohesive validation experience:

1. **EditContext**: The central validation manager.
2. **FieldIdentifier**: Uniquely identifying form fields.
3. **ValidationMessageStore**: Storing validation messages.
4. **Validation Flow**: Step-by-step process.

### 1.1. `EditContext`: The Central Validation Manager

In Blazor, `EditContext` is the heart of form validation. It tracks changes to form fields, manages validation, and provides an event system to notify components when validation happens.

When you use an `EditForm` component, it automatically creates an `EditContext` instance wrapped around your model. This context becomes the central coordination point for all validation-related activities.

```csharp
// This is what happens behind the scenes when you use EditForm
var editContext = new EditContext(yourModel);
```

The `EditContext` exposes several important events:
- `OnValidationRequested`: Triggered when full-form validation is requested (typically on submit).
- `OnFieldChanged`: Triggered when any field in the model changes.
- `OnValidationStateChanged`: Triggered when the validation state of any field changes.

If you manually create an `EditContext`, you can control validation yourself.

```c#
<EditForm EditContext="_editContext">
    <DataAnnotationsValidator />

    <label>Name:</label>
    <InputText @bind-Value="user.Name" />
    <ValidationMessage For="@(()=> user.Name)" />

    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary w-100">Sign Up</button>
</EditForm>

@code {
    private User user = new User();
    private EditContext? _editContext;

    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        _editContext = new EditContext(user);

        // Subscribing to EditContext events
        _editContext.OnValidationRequested += HandleValidationRequested;
        _editContext.OnFieldChanged += HandleFieldChanged;
        _editContext.OnValidationStateChanged += HandleValidationStateChanged;
    }

    private void HandleFieldChanged(object? sender, FieldChangedEventArgs e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Field changed: {e.FieldIdentifier.FieldName}");
    }

    private void HandleValidationRequested(object? sender, ValidationRequestedEventArgs e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Validation requested for the entire form.");
    }

    private void HandleValidationStateChanged(object? sender, ValidationStateChangedEventArgs e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Validation state changed.");
    }

    public class User
    {
        [Required(ErrorMessage = "Name is required")]
        public string Name { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    }
}
```

The `EditContext` is created for the `user` model. Any field change will be tracked and validated.

---
### 1.2. `FieldIdentifier`: Uniquely Identifying Form Fields

In Blazor, `FieldIdentifier` is a struct that uniquely identifies a field within an `EditContext`.

Every input field in a form belongs to a model (e.g., `user`) and has a property name (e.g., `"Name"`). Blazor needs a way to track validation messages for each field separately. This is exactly what `FieldIdentifier` does:

- It uniquely represents a form field by linking it to both the model instance and the property name.
- This ensures that validation messages are field-specific and do not get mixed up.

---
#### How Blazor Uses `FieldIdentifier`

Whenever a validation rule applies to a field, Blazor needs to:
- Identify which field is affected.
- Retrieve or store validation messages for that specific field.
- Notify the UI to update that field accordingly.

Internally, Blazor creates a `FieldIdentifier` for every form field:

```csharp
var field = new FieldIdentifier(user, nameof(user.Name));
```

This helps Blazor link errors directly to `user.Name` and not some other property like `user.Email`.

---
#### Deep Dive: `FieldIdentifier` Structure

The `FieldIdentifier` struct is defined as follows:

```csharp
public readonly struct FieldIdentifier
{
    public object Model { get; }
    public string FieldName { get; }

    public FieldIdentifier(object model, string fieldName)
    {
        Model = model;
        FieldName = fieldName;
    }

    public override bool Equals(object? obj)
    {
        return
            obj is FieldIdentifier fieldIdentifier &&
            fieldIdentifier.Model == Model &&
            fieldIdentifier.FieldName == FieldName;
    }

    public override int GetHashCode()
    {
        return HashCode.Combine(Model, FieldName);
    }
}
```

---
#### Why Does Blazor Need `FieldIdentifier`?

1. **To Store and Retrieve Validation Messages Efficiently**:
   Blazor uses `FieldIdentifier` as a key to track validation errors in `ValidationMessageStore`. This way, each field has its own unique validation messages.

2. **To Detect and React to Field Changes**:
   When a user types in an input field, Blazor uses `FieldIdentifier` to know which field was modified.

3. **To Update the UI Dynamically**:
   `<ValidationMessage>` components use `FieldIdentifier` to show or hide errors only for the relevant field.

---
### 1.3. `ValidationMessageStore`: Storing Validation Messages

At the core of Blazor’s validation system lies the `ValidationMessageStore`, a specialized container that holds validation messages associated with specific form fields. It is tightly coupled with the `EditContext` and acts as a temporary in-memory store where validation results are recorded and retrieved.

Blazor needs a way to store error messages dynamically for each field, ensuring that when a validation check is performed, the errors can be associated with the correct input. Since forms are interactive and can be updated in real time, the validation messages must be tracked per field, per instance of the model. This is where `ValidationMessageStore` comes in—it maps validation errors to `FieldIdentifiers`, which uniquely represent form fields.

Internally, `ValidationMessageStore` is essentially a dictionary-like structure where keys are `FieldIdentifier` objects, and values are collections of validation messages. This allows multiple errors to be associated with a single field.

When a validation provider (like `DataAnnotationsValidator`) processes validation rules, it first clears any existing messages for the field before adding new ones. This ensures that outdated errors are not displayed. The `EditContext` then fires `NotifyValidationStateChanged()`, informing the UI that validation messages have been updated. Components such as `<ValidationMessage>` subscribe to these updates, fetching the latest error messages from the `ValidationMessageStore` and displaying them dynamically.

Blazor does not expose `ValidationMessageStore` directly in most high-level scenarios, as it is managed internally by `EditContext`. However, developers can manually interact with it when implementing custom validation mechanisms, enabling dynamic error injection or real-time validation logic beyond `DataAnnotations`.

---
### 1.4. Validation Flow: Step by Step

The validation process in Blazor is deeply integrated with the form lifecycle and operates through a structured sequence of events. The moment a user interacts with a form field, changes are tracked, validation rules are applied, and UI updates are triggered accordingly.

Everything begins with an `EditContext`, which serves as the form’s central validation manager. When a user types in an input field, the `EditContext` detects the change and fires the `OnFieldChanged` event. This event allows Blazor to monitor modifications and determine when validation should occur. In most cases, validation is deferred until the field loses focus, preventing unnecessary revalidation on every keystroke.

Once validation is triggered, Blazor invokes the registered validation providers. If `DataAnnotationsValidator` is used, it retrieves all properties of the model and applies their validation attributes, such as `[Required]`, `[Range]`, or `[EmailAddress]`. The validation provider calls `.GetValidationResult()` on each field, checking if the input satisfies its constraints.

For each validation failure, a `FieldIdentifier` is created, mapping the validation error to the correct property within the model. These errors are then stored in the `ValidationMessageStore`. If a field previously had errors that are now resolved (e.g., the user enters a valid value), its existing messages are removed before the new validation results are stored.

Once validation completes, `NotifyValidationStateChanged()` is invoked. This is a crucial step, as it signals all dependent UI components to refresh. The `<ValidationMessage>` component listens for these changes and queries the `ValidationMessageStore` for any errors related to its associated `FieldIdentifier`. If messages exist, they are displayed next to the corresponding input field. Otherwise, any previously displayed errors disappear.

When the user submits the form, Blazor performs a full-form validation instead of per-field validation. The `OnValidationRequested` event is fired, instructing all registered validators to validate the entire model. This ensures that every required field is checked, even if the user never interacted with it. If any errors are found, they are stored in `ValidationMessageStore`, and submission is prevented until all issues are resolved.

If validation passes, Blazor invokes the `OnValidSubmit` event, indicating that the form can be processed. At this point, the application can proceed with actions such as saving data to a database or sending it to an API.

A fundamental aspect of this flow is that Blazor does not block form submission based on validation. Unlike traditional HTML forms, where required fields must be filled before submission, Blazor gives developers complete control over how validation results are handled. This allows advanced scenarios such as conditional form validation, real-time validation updates, and server-side validation integration.

In summary, validation in Blazor follows a reactive flow:

1. **User interacts with a form field** → `OnFieldChanged` fires → Validation runs.
2. **Errors are stored in `ValidationMessageStore`** → UI updates dynamically.
3. **On form submission**, `OnValidationRequested` runs full validation → Blocks or allows submit.
4. **If the form is valid**, `OnValidSubmit` is triggered → Application processes the data.

## 2. Why `DataAnnotations` Are Used and Their Advantages

In Blazor (and .NET in general), `DataAnnotations` provide a declarative, attribute-based way to define validation rules on model properties. Instead of manually implementing validation logic, developers can use predefined attributes such as `[Required]`, `[Range]`, or `[EmailAddress]` to enforce constraints on user input.

---
### The Primary Reasons Why `DataAnnotations` Are Widely Used Include:

2.1. **Declarative and Readable**:
   `DataAnnotations` allow developers to define validation rules directly within the model, keeping the validation logic close to the data structure. This makes code easier to read.

```csharp
public class User
{
   [Required]
   [StringLength(50)]
   public string Name { get; set; }

   [Range(18, 100)]
   public int Age { get; set; }
}
```

   Here, the `User` model self-describes its validation constraints, making it immediately clear what values are allowed.

2.2. **Built-In .NET Integration**:
`DataAnnotations` are natively supported in .NET, meaning they work seamlessly across various frameworks including Blazor, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, and WPF. This consistency allows developers to use the same validation rules across different application layers.

Blazor handles this automatically, or you can make it yourself also like this:

```csharp
private EditContext? _editContext;
protected override void OnInitialized()
{
   _editContext = new EditContext(user);
   bool isValid = _editContext.Validate();

   base.OnInitialized();
}
```

In other .NET environments, like WPF, there is a similar way to validate a model using `DataAnnotations`, though it's not as automatic as in Blazor. You can leverage the `ValidationContext` and `Validator` classes to check whether the model is valid.

#### 2.2.1. Create the Model with DataAnnotations
First, define your model class with validation attributes:

``` c#
public class User
{
    [Required(ErrorMessage = "Name is required.")]
    public string Name { get; set; }

    [Range(18, 100, ErrorMessage = "Age must be between 18 and 100.")]
    public int Age { get; set; }
}
```

#### 2.2.2. Use the Validator Class
In WPF, you can use the Validator class to validate the model. 
The Validator.TryValidateObject method checks if the object meets the validation criteria specified by the data annotations.

``` c#
protected override void OnInitialized()
{
    bool? isValid = _editContext?.Validate();

    List<ValidationResult> validationResults = new List<ValidationResult>();
    ValidationContext validationContext = new ValidationContext(user);

    bool isValid = Validator.TryValidateObject(user, validationContext, validationResults);
    if (!Validator.TryValidateObject(user, validationContext, validationResults))
    {
        validationResults.ForEach(valResult =>
        {
            Console.WriteLine(valResult.ErrorMessage);
        });
    }
}
```

##### Explanation:
- Validator.TryValidateObject is the key function for validating a model.
- The validationResults list will hold all the validation errors (if any).
- If the model is valid, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

2.3. **Automatic Validation Handling**:
- Blazor’s `DataAnnotationsValidator` automatically scans model properties for `DataAnnotations` and applies them without requiring manual validation logic. When an `EditForm` is submitted, it invokes `DataAnnotationsValidator`, which:
- Reads validation attributes from the model.
- Runs the validation rules.
- Stores errors in `ValidationMessageStore`.
- Notifies the UI to display error messages.

This automation saves significant development time and ensures consistency in validation enforcement.

2.4. **Supports Custom Validation**:
While built-in attributes cover many common cases, `DataAnnotations` also support custom validation. Developers can define their own validation attributes by inheriting from `ValidationAttribute`.

```csharp
public class MustBeEvenAttribute : ValidationAttribute
{
   protected override ValidationResult? IsValid(object? value, ValidationContext validationContext)
   {
	   if (value is int intValue && intValue % 2 != 0)
	   {
		   return new ValidationResult("The number must be even");
	   }

	   return ValidationResult.Success;
   }
}
```

```c#
<InputNumber @bind-Value="user.Number" />
<ValidationMessage For="@(()=> user.Number)" />
```

This custom attribute ensures that the input number is always even.

---
## 3. Built-In Validation Attributes and How They Function

In .NET, `DataAnnotations` provides a set of built-in validation attributes that can be applied to properties in your models to enforce certain validation rules. These attributes simplify the validation process by allowing you to specify validation rules directly in your model class without writing manual validation logic.

---
### Key Built-In Validation Attributes and Their Functions

1. **[Required] - Ensures a Value is Provided**:
The `[Required]` attribute ensures that a property is not null or empty. It is typically used for fields that must have a value, such as a name, email, or any mandatory information.

```csharp
public class User
{
   [Required(ErrorMessage = "Name is required.")]
   public string Name { get; set; }
}
```

2. **[StringLength] - Restricts the Length of Strings**:
The `[StringLength]` attribute defines the maximum and optionally minimum length for a string property. This is useful when you need to limit the size of a text field, such as a username or description.

```csharp
public class Product
{
[StringLength(50, MinimumLength = 3, ErrorMessage = "Product name must be between 3 and 50 characters.")]
   public string Name { get; set; }
}
```

This ensures that `Name` is at least 3 characters long but no longer than 50 characters.

3. **[Range] - Validates a Numeric Range**:
The `[Range]` attribute enforces that a numeric value falls between a minimum and maximum value. This is often used for numerical fields, like age, price, or quantity.

```csharp
public class Order
{
   [Range(1, 100, ErrorMessage = "Quantity must be between 1 and 100.")]
   public int Quantity { get; set; }
}
```

This validates that the `Quantity` is between 1 and 100, ensuring valid numeric input.

4. **[EmailAddress] - Validates Email Format**:
The `[EmailAddress]` attribute checks whether the input follows the basic structure of a valid email address (e.g., `user@example.com`). This is commonly used for form fields where the user enters an email address.

```csharp
public class Contact
{
   [EmailAddress(ErrorMessage = "Enter a valid email address.")]
   public string Email { get; set; }
}
```

If the user enters an invalid email address, the validation fails, and an error message is shown.

5. **[Compare] - Ensures Two Fields Match**:
The `[Compare]` attribute is used to compare two properties to ensure they are equal. This is typically used in scenarios where the user is required to enter the same value in two fields, such as a password and confirm password.

```csharp
public class RegisterModel
{
	[Required]
	public string Password { get; set; }

	[Compare("Password", ErrorMessage = "Passwords must match.")]
	public string ConfirmPassword { get; set; }
}
```

In this example, the `ConfirmPassword` field must match the `Password` field.

6. **[RegularExpression] - Validates a Pattern**:
The `[RegularExpression]` attribute allows you to apply custom validation rules using regular expressions. This is useful when you need to enforce specific patterns like phone numbers, zip codes, or custom codes.

```csharp
public class User
{
   [RegularExpression(@"^\d{10}$", ErrorMessage = "Phone number must be exactly 10 digits.")]
   public string PhoneNumber { get; set; }
}
```

7. **[Range] - Numeric Range (Alternative)**:
While the `[Range]` attribute is more general, for numbers specifically, the `[Range]` attribute can also be used to define a date range.

```csharp
public class Product
{
   [Range(typeof(DateTime), "01/01/2022", "12/31/2022", ErrorMessage = "Date must be within 2022.")]
   public DateTime ReleaseDate { get; set; }
}
```

This ensures that `ReleaseDate` is within the year 2022.

8. **[Url] - Validates a URL**:
The `[Url]` attribute validates whether a string is a valid URL. It checks that the input is a proper web address (e.g., `https://www.example.com`).

```csharp
public class Website
{
   [Url(ErrorMessage = "Please enter a valid URL.")]
   public string WebsiteUrl { get; set; }
}
```
