## 1. Introduction to Indexing in SQL

An **index** in SQL is a special data structure that helps improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table. It is similar to an index in a book, where instead of flipping through every page to find a topic, you can quickly refer to the index, which tells you exactly where to look.

Indexes do **not** store the actual data; instead, they store **pointers** (references) to the locations of data rows in a table. This significantly **reduces the number of disk reads**, making queries much faster.

### **Why Are Indexes Needed?**

When a query is executed, the database management system (DBMS) must **search through all rows** to find relevant data. This process is called a **full table scan**, and it becomes extremely slow as the table grows larger. Indexes help by allowing the database to **jump directly to the relevant rows** instead of scanning every record.

### 2. Different Types of Disks: HDD vs SSD
There are **different types of disks** used for storage:

**1. Hard Disk Drive (HDD)**:

In HDDs, there is a **moving arm** that reads and writes data on spinning **disks** (also called platters). This arm moves over the surface of the disks to find the right spot to read or write the data. It's **not a human arm**, but rather a metal arm inside the HDD that operates automatically.
[IMAGE](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-O03iQs9L4ZA/Vjf9KaIekGI/AAAAAAAADEA/tffkNGw_f1U/s1600/hard_drive_inside.jpg)

Here's how it works:

1. The **disks** inside the HDD spin very fast (like a turntable).
2. The **arm** moves to different positions over the spinning disk to read or write data.
3. The **data** is stored in small areas on the disk, and the arm needs to find and access the correct area to read or write that data.

This mechanical process is what makes HDDs **slower** than **SSDs** (Solid State Drives), which have no moving parts.

**2. Solid State Drive (SSD)**:
No Moving Parts (Unlike HDDs)

Unlike **Hard Disk Drives (HDDs)**, which have **mechanical parts** like spinning disks and moving arms to read and write data, **SSDs have no moving parts**. Instead of physical **disks** that spin, **SSDs use flash memory chips** to store data. These chips are similar to the ones used in USB drives or memory cards, but they are much faster and designed for larger storage capacities.

The key difference here is that **SSDs store data electronically**, which means there are no moving parts involved, making them **faster, more durable, and quieter** than HDDs.

#### Flash Memory

At the heart of an SSD is **flash memory**, specifically **NAND flash**. It is a non-volatile memory, which means it doesn't require power to store data. Here's how SSDs use flash memory:

- **Data Storage:** SSDs store data in **cells** within **flash memory chips**. These cells are organized in a grid, and each cell can hold a certain amount of data (usually 1 bit, 2 bits, or more, depending on the type of NAND).
    
- **Data Access:** To read or write data, the SSD uses **electrical signals** to access the data in these cells. Since there's no physical arm moving like in HDDs, SSDs can access any part of the memory almost instantly, leading to **faster read/write speeds**.

#### The Controller

Every SSD has a **controller** that manages how data is written to and read from the flash memory cells. The controller handles:

- **Wear leveling**: Ensuring that data is distributed evenly across the memory cells to prevent any single cell from being written too many times, which would wear it out.
    
- **Error correction**: Ensuring that data is correctly written and read from the memory cells, and that any errors are corrected automatically.
    
- **Garbage collection**: SSDs can suffer from **write amplification**, so the controller ensures that unused data is cleaned up and made ready for new writes.
    

#### Data Writing Process

One important aspect of **SSDs** is that they cannot directly overwrite data in a cell. Instead, data has to be written to a new location, and old data is marked for deletion. This is where **garbage collection** comes into play to clean up these old blocks of data. This is quite different from HDDs, where data can simply be overwritten directly.

### Key Differences Between HDDs and SSDs

1. **Speed**
    
    - **HDDs**: Due to the mechanical nature of spinning disks and moving arms, **HDDs are slower** in reading and writing data. They suffer from **seek time** (time it takes to move the read/write head to the correct position on the disk).
        
    - **SSDs**: **SSDs are much faster** because there are no moving parts. Data can be read and written almost instantly, providing **significant speed improvements** in things like boot times, file transfers, and application load times.
        
2. **Durability**
    
    - **HDDs**: Since **HDDs have moving parts**, they are more **prone to failure** from physical damage, such as dropping or impact. The spinning disks and moving arm can be damaged if the drive is physically impacted.
        
    - **SSDs**: **SSDs are more durable** because they have no moving parts. They are much less likely to be damaged by physical shock, making them ideal for laptops or mobile devices where portability is key.
        
3. **Noise**
    
    - **HDDs**: The **spinning disks** and **moving arm** in HDDs can create **noise** during operation.
    - **SSDs**: Since **SSDs have no moving parts**, they operate **silently**.
        
4. **Power Consumption**
    
    - **HDDs**: HDDs require more **power** to spin the disks and move the arm. This makes them **less power-efficient** compared to SSDs, especially in laptops where battery life is important.
        
    - **SSDs**: **SSDs consume less power** because they don't have moving parts, making them more energy-efficient and contributing to longer battery life in portable devices.
        
5. **Cost**
    
    - **HDDs**: **HDDs are cheaper** per gigabyte compared to SSDs, making them a more cost-effective option for large storage capacities.
        
    - **SSDs**: **SSDs are more expensive** than HDDs, but prices have been dropping steadily. SSDs offer **better value** for performance-oriented tasks, while HDDs are still used for bulk storage.


### How SSDs Store Data Internally

As mentioned earlier, SSDs store data in **flash memory cells** made of **NAND** technology. Here’s a breakdown of how this data storage works:

1. **Memory Cells**: The flash memory cells in an SSD are organized in pages, and each page contains a small amount of data. These pages are grouped into **blocks** (usually 128 or 256 pages per block).
    
2. **Reading Data**: When the SSD needs to read data, it quickly retrieves the data from the relevant pages in the blocks. This is much faster than an HDD, where the read/write head has to move to a specific location on the spinning disk.
    
3. **Writing Data**: When new data is written to an SSD, it **cannot overwrite existing data**. Instead, the SSD writes the data to a **new block**. Once the new data is written, the old block is marked as invalid and is later erased during the garbage collection process.
    
4. **Erase and Write Cycles**: Flash memory in SSDs has a limited number of **erase and write cycles** (about 3,000 to 100,000 cycles, depending on the quality of the NAND). As a result, SSDs use techniques like **wear leveling** to ensure that the data is spread evenly across the memory cells, which helps extend the lifespan of the drive.


### SSD Structure Overview

1. **Flash Memory Cells**: This is where data is stored in the SSD. These are the smallest units.
2. **Pages**: These are small groups of memory cells. Each **page** contains a small amount of data, typically **4KB to 16KB**.
3. **Blocks**: **Pages** are grouped together to form **blocks**. Typically, each **block** consists of **128 to 256 pages**. Blocks are the larger storage unit, and they play an important role in organizing and managing the data inside the SSD.

### 3. SQL and Data Storage
When it comes to SQL databases:

1. **Where is the Data Stored?**
    
    - The data in SQL is stored on **disk**—either an HDD or SSD, depending on the system configuration.
    - The **SQL Server** is the software responsible for **managing** the database. It doesn't directly store the data on its own; instead, it **communicates with the operating system** to store the data on the physical disk.

2. **How Does SQL Write Data to Disk?**
    
    - When you insert or update data, SQL Server **writes the data to disk** in **blocks** (small chunks of storage).
    - SQL Server **does this automatically** in the background to keep things organized and ensure that data is safe (i.e., saved to disk even if the system crashes).
    - SQL keeps track of all **writes**, and when changes happen, it updates the appropriate **blocks** on the disk.

### **What is a Disk Block?**
**Disk Block**: A **block** is a small, fixed-size unit of data storage on the disk. It could be around **4KB** or **8KB** in size (this can vary depending on the system).

- **How Data Is Stored**:
    - SQL Server stores **multiple rows** of a table within one block.
    - When you query the database, SQL Server reads the **block** that contains the data you're looking for. If the data is spread across multiple blocks, SQL needs to read each block, one by one.

### 4. SQL Server and Indexes: How They Improve Query Performance

In SQL Server, an **index** is a crucial data structure that helps improve the speed of data retrieval. Without an index, SQL Server has to perform a **full table scan**, which can be very slow, especially when working with large tables. Let's dive deeper into how indexes work and how they impact the way SQL Server interacts with data at the storage level (using blocks, pages, and cells).

We already know that SQL data is stored in tables. Each table is broken down into rows, and the rows are stored across **blocks** in **pages** on the disk (SSD or HDD). Here's a refresher:

- **Rows** are the individual data points.
- **Blocks** are the physical storage units on disk (SSD/HDD) where **pages** are stored.
- **Pages** are the logical storage units that hold data in SQL Server, and each page is typically **8 KB**.

### Full Table Scan: What Happens Without an Index?
Let’s say we have a table with **100,000 rows**, and we run a query like:

``` c#
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = 'Mahammad';
```

If there is **no index** on the `name` column, SQL Server performs a **full table scan**. This means that:

1. SQL Server starts from the first row of the table and goes through each row sequentially.
2. It **reads blocks of data** from the disk, checking each row in the block to see if it matches `'Mahammad'`. It continues this until it finds all the matching rows or reaches the end of the table.
3. If the table is large, SQL Server will read **thousands of blocks** from the disk, even if only a few rows match `'Mahammad'`.

This process can be **slow**, as reading data from the disk takes time, and when there is no index, SQL Server cannot **jump directly** to the rows that match the query.

> **Data Storage in Blocks and Pages**
> 
> 1. **Rows and Pages:**
>     
>     - SQL Server stores data in **pages**, with each page typically being **8 KB** in size.
>     - Each row in a table doesn't have to occupy a full page; several rows can fit into a single page, depending on the row size.
>         
> 2. **Pages and Blocks:**
>     
>     - A **block** is a **physical storage unit** on disk, and it may contain multiple pages. For example, a block may contain several pages of data, and each page can hold multiple rows.
>     - The **block size** on a disk can vary, but the important thing is that SQL Server manages data in **pages**, not directly in blocks.
>     - One **page** can store multiple rows if the rows are small enough to fit. The actual number of rows that fit in a page depends on the size of each row.   
> 
> **Example with 100,000 Rows**
> 
> Let's say you have a table with **100,000 rows**. If each row is relatively small (for example, 100 bytes), it might fit about **80 rows** per page (since 8 KB per page).
> 
> - If there are **100,000 rows**, and **80 rows fit in one page**, you would need approximately **1,250 pages** (100,000 ÷ 80 = 1,250).
> - These **1,250 pages** would then be distributed across **multiple blocks** on the disk.
>     
> Therefore, the number of blocks is not equal to the number of rows. The actual storage depends on how many pages fit into each block, how many rows fit into each page, and how SQL Server handles this on disk.


### **What Happens When You Add an Index in SQL Server?**

Imagine your SQL Server database as a giant book where every table is like a chapter. Inside each chapter, rows are like pages, and every page has data. Without an index, SQL Server would need to read every page of the book to find what you're looking for. But an **index** is like a table of contents that helps SQL Server quickly find the information you need without reading the entire book.

Here’s a **step-by-step** breakdown:
### **1. What is an Index?**

An **index** in SQL Server is like a **shortcut**. It helps the database quickly locate specific data without going through every row in a table. It's like using an index in a book to find the page number of the topic you're looking for, instead of reading the whole book from start to finish.

- **Index Structure:** An index in SQL Server is often built using a **B-tree** or **Clustered Index** structure. The B-tree is a sorted list of values (like a dictionary), where each value points to the actual data.

### 2. **How Does an Index Work?**
Let’s say you have a table of **customer names** and want to find all customers with the name **“Mahammad”**.

Without an index:
- SQL Server would need to go through each **row** of the table, one by one, to check if the name is “Mahammad.” or not. This is called a **full table scan**, and it can be very slow if the table has many rows.

With an index:
- SQL Server creates a **sorted list** of all the values in the `name` column, and stores **pointers** to the actual rows where each name is located.
- When you search for **“Mahammad”**, SQL Server doesn’t need to check every row. It looks up **“Mahammad”** in the sorted list (index), and jumps directly to the rows where **“Mahammad”** is located.

When SQL Server creates an **index**, it organizes the data in a **sorted structure** like a **dictionary** or a **map**, where:

1. The **indexed column(s)** (e.g., `name`) become the **keys**.    
2. The **values** associated with those keys are **pointers (or references)** to the actual **rows** in the table where that key (e.g., "Mahammad") is located.

### Here’s how it works:

**Sorted Index**:

- SQL Server first **sorts** all the values from the indexed column (e.g., `name`) in ascending or descending order (based on how the index is defined).
- The index structure resembles a **sorted dictionary**:
	- **Key**: A value from the indexed column (e.g., "Mahammad").
	- **Pointer**: A reference to the actual row in the table that contains that value.

For example, if you have a table like this:

| ID  | Name     | Age |
| --- | -------- | --- |
| 1   | Bjorn    | 25  |
| 2   | Mahammad | 21  |
| 3   | Ragnar   | 40  |
| 4   | Mahammad | 21  |
| 5   | Lagerta  | 30  |
The index on `Name` would look something like this:
**Index on `Name`:**

| Name     | Pointer (Row Reference) |
| -------- | ----------------------- |
| Bjorn    | Row 1                   |
| Lagerta  | Row 5                   |
| Mahammad | Row 2                   |
| Mahammad | Row 4                   |
| Ragnar   | Row 3                   |

### Recap

When SQL Server stores information on disk, it organizes everything into chunks called **pages**. A **page** is the smallest unit of storage, and it is always **8 KB** in size. Imagine a page like a small container that holds data. This is where both **your table data** (the actual rows) and **indexes** are stored, but in different kinds of pages.

For example, in a table with lots of rows, SQL Server doesn't store all the rows in one place. Instead, it divides them across many **data pages**. Each page can hold several rows, depending on how big each row is. So, if each row in your table is **100 bytes**, a single page can hold about **80 rows** (since 8 KB per page divided by 100 bytes per row gives us 80 rows).

Now, let's say you create an index on a column, like the `name` column in your table. An index is just a way to organize data more efficiently, like creating a list of contents for a book. SQL Server builds a **sorted list** of values from the column (e.g., all the names in the `name` column), and each name in this list has a **pointer** that tells SQL Server exactly where to find the row that matches that name in the table. This sorted list of names is also stored in **index pages**. These pages are organized similarly to data pages, but instead of holding the actual data, they hold the **sorted key values** (names) and the **pointers** to the corresponding rows in the table.

So, in the background, you have two types of pages: **data pages** that hold the actual rows from the table, and **index pages** that hold the sorted list of index keys and pointers. Both types of pages are stored on the disk, and SQL Server takes care of organizing them efficiently.

SQL Server stores these pages in **blocks** on the disk, which are the storage units at the disk level (like in SSDs or HDDs). A **block** can hold multiple pages, depending on its size. For example, a block might be **64 KB**, so it could hold **8 pages** (since each page is 8 KB). When SQL Server writes data or index pages, it places them into blocks, and the blocks are stored on the disk.

This way, SQL Server makes sure that the data and the index are stored separately, and it organizes them into pages for efficient access. When you run a query, SQL Server doesn't have to scan the entire table. Instead, it can quickly look up values in the index pages, find the pointers, and jump straight to the corresponding rows in the data pages. This speeds up the search process and makes everything much faster.

In short, **SQL Server uses pages to organize data and indexes**, and **blocks** are where these pages are stored on the disk. The system is designed to be efficient, so instead of looking through every row of data, SQL Server can use indexes to jump straight to the right place.

---
SQL Server uses **metadata** to keep track of the different types of pages (data or index). This metadata helps the system identify the purpose of each page.

Here’s how SQL Server knows whether a page is a **data page** or an **index page**:

1. **Page Header**: Every page in SQL Server has a small section at the beginning called the **page header**. This header contains important information about the page, such as its type and its usage. It helps SQL Server determine the role of the page.
    
2. **Page Types in the Header**: The **page header** includes a **page type** field that tells SQL Server what kind of page it is:
    
    - **Data Pages**: For data pages, the page type might be something like **"Data"** or **"Heap"** (if it's a heap table without a clustered index).
    - **Index Pages**: For index pages, the page type will specify it's part of an **index** (such as a **leaf page** or **non-leaf page** for B-tree structures).

3. **Page Structures**: The contents of the page also follow a specific structure:
    
    - **Data Pages**: These contain **rows** of actual data, organized by columns.
    - **Index Pages**: These contain **keys and pointers** to data rows. For clustered indexes, the leaf index pages will contain the actual data rows (but organized in a sorted order), whereas non-leaf index pages contain references to other index pages.

So, even if data pages and index pages end up being stored in the same block, SQL Server can identify them by examining the **page header** and **page structure**. The system uses this internal organization to ensure that it can properly interpret the contents of the page, regardless of where it's physically located on the disk.

### What is an Index?

An **index** in a database is similar to an index in a book. It helps you find information faster without having to search through the entire book (or in this case, the entire table). In databases, an index is a data structure that speeds up the retrieval of data by providing a quick way to look up rows in a table based on specific columns.

1. **Clustered Index**
2. **Non-Clustered Index**

---
### **1. Clustered Index**
What is a Clustered Index?

Imagine a **library** where all the books are sorted alphabetically by title. The books themselves are physically arranged on the shelves in alphabetical order. This means that when you search for a book by title, you don’t need to check every single book because they are already sorted.

In a **clustered index**, the data in the table is physically sorted and stored on the disk based on the column(s) you choose to index (like `CustomerName` or `CustomerID`). The index determines the order of the rows themselves in the database.

#### How Does It Work?

- When you create a clustered index on a column (e.g., `CustomerName`), the database **physically arranges** the rows in the table in **sorted order** according to that column.
- For example, if the column is `CustomerName`, the database will store the rows in alphabetical order of the customer names, so when you query based on the customer name, the database can quickly retrieve the sorted rows.
- You can think of the clustered index as organizing the actual data itself, not just creating a separate "list" of references to the data.

#### Example:
Let's say we have the following table of customers:

|CustomerID|CustomerName|CustomerEmail|
|---|---|---|
|1|Ali|ali@email.com|
|3|Leyla|leyla@email.com|
|2|Mahammad|mahammad@email.com|

If we create a clustered index on `CustomerName`, the table’s rows will be physically arranged in alphabetical order based on `CustomerName`, like this:

|CustomerID|CustomerName|CustomerEmail|
|---|---|---|
|1|Ali|ali@email.com|
|2|Mahammad|mahammad@email.com|
|3|Leyla|leyla@email.com|

So now, the table is **physically sorted** by `CustomerName`. When we query the data based on `CustomerName`, the database doesn't need to sort the data again because it's already in order.

#### Key Points:

- **One clustered index per table** because the data can only be sorted in one way (you can't sort it by multiple columns at the same time).
- The rows themselves are physically arranged on the disk in the order defined by the clustered index.
- A clustered index is often created on a **unique column** like `CustomerID` (or the primary key).

---
### **2. Non-Clustered Index**
What is a Non-Clustered Index?

Imagine a **library** where the books are not arranged in alphabetical order on the shelves. However, there is a **catalog** or **index book** where you can find the titles of all the books in alphabetical order. The catalog gives you the title of the book, and next to each title, it tells you the shelf number where that book is located.

A **non-clustered index** works like this catalog. It does not change the order of the actual data on the disk. Instead, it creates a **separate index structure** that contains the values of the indexed column(s) and pointers (or references) to the actual data rows in the table.

#### How Does It Work?

- When you create a non-clustered index on a column (e.g., `CustomerName`), the database creates a **separate index structure** (usually a **B-tree**) that stores the sorted values of the indexed column and **pointers** to the corresponding rows in the table.
- The **data rows** in the table remain in their original order, but the non-clustered index provides a quick way to find the rows based on the indexed column.

#### Example:
Let’s take the same customer table from earlier, and this time create a **non-clustered index** on `CustomerName`. The non-clustered index will look something like this:

| CustomerName | Pointer to Data Row |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| Ali          | Row 1               |
| Leyla        | Row 3               |
| Mahammad     | Row 2               |
Here, the non-clustered index **stores the sorted values** of `CustomerName`, and each row contains a **pointer** to the actual data row in the table.

So when you query the database by `CustomerName`, the database will:

1. Look up the sorted `CustomerName` values in the index.
2. Follow the pointer to the corresponding row in the table.

The data itself is still not sorted on the disk, but the non-clustered index provides a **fast lookup** by using the **sorted list** and **pointers**.

#### Key Points:

- **Multiple non-clustered indexes can exist on a table**, each for different columns.
- The **data is not physically rearranged**. The index is a **separate structure** that helps find the data.
- Non-clustered indexes are good for **speeding up queries on columns that are frequently searched**, but they do **require extra storage** because they are separate from the actual table data.

---
### B-tree and How It Works in Non-Clustered Indexes

The **B-tree** (Balanced Tree) is a type of **data structure** used by the database to store and organize the index values in a **sorted manner**.

- **B-tree** works by breaking down the index into a **hierarchical structure** of nodes.
- At the **top** level is the **root node**, and each node contains **pointers to other nodes** (or leaf nodes). The leaf nodes contain the actual indexed values (like `CustomerName`).
- The database uses this **sorted tree structure** to find values quickly, usually in **O(log n)** time, where **n** is the number of index entries.

---
### Step 1: Understanding Index Naming Convention

When you create an index, it’s essential to give it a meaningful name that indicates the table and column(s) involved in the index. In **SQL Server** (and EF Core), there’s a **recommended naming convention** that follows this pattern:

#### Convention Pattern for Index Names:

``` c#
IX_<TableName>_<ColumnName(s)>
```

Where:
- `IX` is the standard prefix for **indexes**.
- `<TableName>` is the name of the table where the index is applied.
- `<ColumnName(s)>` refers to the column(s) that the index is based on.

**Example**:
For the `Customers` table with a non-clustered index on `CustomerName`, the index name would be:

``` c#
IX_Customers_CustomerName
```

This follows the pattern:
- **IX**: Indicates this is an index.
- **Customers**: The table the index is applied to.
- **CustomerName**: The column the index is based on.


### Step 2: SQL Code to Create Clustered and Non-Clustered Indexes

**1. Clustered Index**:

- A clustered index can only be created on one column per table, and it defines the physical order of the data.
- It is often created on the **primary key** (unique column).

``` sql
CREATE TABLE Customers (
	-- This implicitly creates a clustered index on CustomerId
    CustomerId INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerName VARCHAR(100),
    CustomerEmail VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Explicitly creating a clustered index on CustomerName 
(not usually done since the primary key is clustered by default)

CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX IX_Customers_CustomerName ON Customers(CustomerName);
```

Code Examples

``` sql
CREATE TABLE NewCustomers (
    CustomerId INT UNIQUE,
    CustomerName VARCHAR(100),
    CustomerEmail VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX IX_NewCustomers_CustomerName ON NewCustomers(CustomerName)

INSERT INTO NewCustomers (CustomerId, CustomerName, CustomerEmail)
VALUES 
(1, 'Charlie', 'charlie@example.com'),
(2, 'Alice', 'alice@example.com'),
(3, 'David', 'david@example.com'),
(4, 'Bob', 'bob@example.com'),
(5, 'Eva', 'eva@example.com'),
(6, 'Frank', 'frank@example.com'),
(7, 'Grace', 'grace@example.com'),
(8, 'Jack', 'jack@example.com'),
(9, 'Irene', 'irene@example.com'),
(10, 'Hannah', 'hannah@example.com');

SELECT * FROM NewCustomers

CustomerId	CustomerName	CustomerEmail
2	        Alice	        alice@example.com
4	        Bob	            bob@example.com
1	        Charlie	        charlie@example.com
3	        David	        david@example.com
5	        Eva	            eva@example.com
6	        Frank	        frank@example.com
7	        Grace	        grace@example.com
10	        Hannah	        hannah@example.com
9	        Irene	        irene@example.com
8	        Jack	        jack@example.com
```

Even though the `INSERT` statements are not in alphabetical order, the **clustered index** will ensure that the rows in the `NewCustomers` table are **physically stored in alphabetical order** by the `CustomerName` column. The database will reorder the rows internally based on `CustomerName` as soon as they are inserted.

**2. Non-Clustered Index**:

- Non-clustered indexes are separate from the data table and don't affect the physical order of the rows.
- You can create multiple non-clustered indexes on different columns in a table.

``` sql
-- Creating a non-clustered index on the CustomerName column
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_Customers_CustomerName ON Customers(CustomerName);

-- Creating a non-clustered index on the CustomerEmail column
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_Customers_CustomerEmail ON Customers(CustomerEmail);
```


### Step 3: EF Core Code to Create Clustered and Non-Clustered Indexes

In **EF Core**, you can use the **Fluent API** to configure indexes. By default, EF Core creates **non-clustered indexes** when you use `HasIndex()`. However, **EF Core does not directly allow you to create clustered indexes**; you will have to use **raw SQL commands** to create clustered indexes.

#### **Creating Non-Clustered Index:**
Let’s say we have a `Customer` table, and we want to create a **non-clustered index** on the `CustomerName` column. Here's how we do it in **EF Core**.

```csharp
public class Customer
{
    public int CustomerId { get; set; }
    public string CustomerName { get; set; }
    public string CustomerEmail { get; set; }
}
```

**Add the `HasIndex()` Fluent API Configuration:**
In EF Core, the `HasIndex()` method allows us to create indexes on specific columns. This will create a **non-clustered index** by default.

```csharp
public class MyDbContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<Customer> Customers { get; set; }

    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        // Create non-clustered index on CustomerName column
        modelBuilder.Entity<Customer>()
            .HasIndex(c => c.CustomerName)
            .HasDatabaseName("IX_Customers_CustomerName");
    }
}
```

In this example:
- `HasIndex(c => c.CustomerName)` tells EF Core to create an index on the `CustomerName` column.
- `HasDatabaseName("IX_Customers_CustomerName")` specifies the name of the index (following a naming convention).

#### **Creating Clustered Index:**
EF Core **does not allow you to directly create a clustered index** using the Fluent API. The default index for the primary key is clustered, but if you want to create a clustered index on a different column (like `CustomerName`), you'll need to use **raw SQL** commands in a migration.

Let’s look at how we can do that.
**Create the Clustered Index Using Raw SQL in Migration:**

After you create your initial migration (via `Add-Migration`), modify the migration to include the **clustered index** creation.

Here’s how you can do it:

```csharp
public partial class AddClusteredIndex : Migration
{
    protected override void Up(MigrationBuilder migrationBuilder)
    {
        // Create the non-clustered index (this is done by default in EF Core)
        migrationBuilder.CreateIndex(
            name: "IX_Customers_CustomerName",
            table: "Customers",
            column: "CustomerName");

        // Create the clustered index using raw SQL 
        // (this is not supported by EF Core directly)
        migrationBuilder.Sql(
            "CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX IX_Customers_CustomerName_Clustered ON    Customers(CustomerName);");
    }

    protected override void Down(MigrationBuilder migrationBuilder)
    {
        // Drop the clustered index
        migrationBuilder.Sql(
            "DROP INDEX IX_Customers_CustomerName_Clustered ON Customers;");

        // Drop the non-clustered index
        migrationBuilder.DropIndex(
            name: "IX_Customers_CustomerName",
            table: "Customers");
    }
}
```

---
### **Use a Clustered Index When:**

- Your queries **frequently search for ranges** of data (e.g., `OrderDate` for sales reports).  
- The table has **a primary key** (by default, this will be the clustered index).  
- The table is **read-heavy** (mostly `SELECT` operations).  
- You want **fast retrieval for the main identifier** (e.g., `CustomerId`).

### **Use a Non-Clustered Index When:**

- Your table has **multiple search columns** (e.g., `CustomerName`, `Email`, `City`).  
- The table **has frequent inserts and updates** (to avoid clustered index reordering).  
- You need to **speed up searches on columns other than the primary key**.  
- The table is **very large** and needs **additional filtering indexes**.
