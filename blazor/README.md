# Blazor Server - Roadmap

This repository exists to provide a structured and thorough learning journey for beginners who want to master Blazor Server. After noticing that most available resources either come from creators with advanced knowledge or from brief, overly simplified explanations, it became clear that there was a gap for comprehensive, accessible content.

The goal of this roadmap is to help developers understand how Blazor Server works "under the hood" by breaking down the concepts and practices in a clear and logical progression. By following this guide, developers will build a strong foundation in Blazor Server, covering everything from the basics of components and routing to more advanced topics like SignalR integration and performance optimization.

Whether you’re building your first Blazor Server application or you’re looking to improve your skills, this roadmap will serve as a go-to reference, ensuring you can learn at your own pace without feeling overwhelmed. Happy coding!
