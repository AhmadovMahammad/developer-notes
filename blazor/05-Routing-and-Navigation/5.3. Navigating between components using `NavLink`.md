Blazor Server uses a component-based approach where navigation is handled dynamically without requiring full-page reloads. The `NavLink` component is a special Blazor element that works similarly to an HTML `<a>` tag but is integrated with Blazor's routing system. It ensures smooth navigation and manages active states automatically.

## How Navigation Works in Blazor Server

When a user clicks a link in a traditional web application, the browser sends a request to the server, and the server responds with a new page. However, Blazor Server intercepts link clicks and renders only the necessary components instead of reloading the whole page.

Blazor accomplishes this by:
- **Listening to navigation events** and preventing the browser from reloading the page.
- **Changing the browser's URL dynamically** while keeping the app state intact.
- **Rendering the target component** associated with the new route.

Blazor relies on Razor components to define pages, and navigation is handled internally without disrupting the overall UI state.

## Understanding `NavLink` vs. `<a>` Tag

Although an `<a>` tag can navigate between pages, it causes a full-page reload. In contrast, `NavLink` is a Blazor-specific component that:
- **Prevents full-page reloads**.
- **Dynamically updates the active link styling**.
- **Works seamlessly with Blazor's routing system**.

## `NavLink` and `Match` Attribute in Blazor Server

Blazor Server provides the `NavLink` component as a replacement for traditional `<a>` tags to ensure seamless client-side navigation. One of its key features is the ability to determine whether a link should be marked as active based on the `Match` attribute.

Understanding how the `Match` attribute works is crucial for properly managing navigation states in a Blazor application. This deep dive will cover:
- **How Blazor Determines Active Links**
- **How `Match` Works (Prefix vs. Exact Matching)**

---
### 1. How Blazor Determines Active Links

Blazor uses `NavLink` to enhance navigation. Unlike a regular `<a>` tag, `NavLink` automatically applies a CSS class (by default, `active`) when the current route matches the link.

#### Example Without `Match` Attribute (Default Behavior)
```c#
<NavLink href="/dashboard" class="nav-link">Dashboard</NavLink>
```

- When the user is on `/dashboard`, Blazor marks this link as active.
- If the user is on `/dashboard/reports`, Blazor still considers the `NavLink` active because it partially matches the current URL.

---
### 2. How `Match` Works (Prefix vs. Exact Matching)

Blazor provides two modes for determining active state:
- **Prefix Matching (`NavLinkMatch.Prefix`)** → The default mode.
- **Exact Matching (`NavLinkMatch.All`)** → Requires a full match.

---
#### Prefix Matching (`NavLinkMatch.Prefix`) [Default]

```c#
<NavLink href="/dashboard" class="nav-link" Match="NavLinkMatch.Prefix">
    Dashboard
</NavLink>
```

- **Active when on `/dashboard`**.
- **Active when on `/dashboard/reports`**.
- **Active when on `/dashboard/analytics`**.

---
#### Exact Matching (`NavLinkMatch.All`)

```c#
<NavLink href="/dashboard" class="nav-link" Match="NavLinkMatch.All">
    Dashboard
</NavLink>
```

- **Active only when on `/dashboard`**.
- **Not active when on `/dashboard/reports`**.
- **Not active when on `/dashboard/analytics`**.

---
## Dynamic Navigation in Code (`NavigationManager`)

Instead of using `NavLink`, navigation can also be handled programmatically using the `NavigationManager` service.

```c#
@inject NavigationManager Navigation

<button @onclick="GoToDashboard">Click me to open Dashboard</button>

@code {
    private void GoToDashboard()
    {
        Navigation.NavigateTo("/dashboard");
    }
}
```

This allows dynamic navigation based on button clicks or other interactions without requiring a `NavLink`.
