# My Python Journey for Interview Preparation

## Introduction
As a C# developer, I realized the importance of diversifying my programming language skills to better prepare for coding interviews. 
I came across advice in the book, which highlighted that knowing only one or two languages could be a limitation during interviews. 
This motivated me to step out of my c# zone and learn Python.

_Knowing Only One or Two Languages: The more time you've spent coding, the more things you've
built, the more languages you will have tended to work with. The assumption then, when they see a
resume with only one language, is that you haven't experienced very many problems. They also often
worry that candidates with only one or two languages will have trouble learning new technologies (why
hasn't the candidate learned more things?) or will just feel too tied with a specific technology (potentially
not using the best language for the task)._

Pythonâ€™s simplicity and versatility made it an ideal choice for tackling Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) on platforms like LeetCode. 
By learning Python, I was able to expand my problem-solving toolkit, 
improve my interview performance, and become more adaptable in different coding environments.
